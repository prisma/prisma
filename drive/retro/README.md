# drive/retro — project-context for retros

Loaded by `drive-run-retro`. Holds prisma-next's retro conventions, recurring-pattern catalogue, and landing-surface preferences.

> **Trial period in effect (ends 2026-06-02).** When any drive-* skill in this category produces a finding, record it in [`findings.md`](./findings.md). Quality bar, tags, and format live in [`drive/trial.md`](../trial.md).

## Landing-surface preferences

When a retro lesson could land in multiple surfaces, the team's preference:

- **Calibration of size / cost / DoR / DoD items** → the matching file under [`drive/calibration/`](../calibration/README.md). These rarely generalise; they're tied to this repo's package layout and CI shape.
- **Triage / sizing heuristics** → triage decision rules go to [`drive/triage/README.md`](../triage/README.md); sizing anchors themselves go to [`drive/calibration/sizing.md`](../calibration/sizing.md).
- **Failure-mode patterns specific to this codebase** → [`drive/calibration/failure-modes.md`](../calibration/failure-modes.md); the matching grep pattern (if any) → [`drive/calibration/grep-library.md`](../calibration/grep-library.md).
- **Failure-mode patterns that generalise to any contract-first system** → canonical (via `drive-update-skills`).
- **Durable architectural decisions** → ADR under [docs/architecture docs/adrs/](../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/).
- **Process changes that affect the whole methodology** → propose upstream PR to `prisma/ignite` (after one or two repetitions to confirm the pattern).

## Recurring-pattern catalogue

Patterns the team has seen multiple times. Each entry: pattern → severity → mitigation surface (where it landed).

## Mandatory-final-retro template

Per `drive-run-retro` § Step 8, the project-close retro covers the project as a whole. Template prompts:

1. **What went well?** Patterns worth keeping; calibrations that proved out; protocol points that earned their cost.
2. **What surprised us?** Things the protocol didn't predict; assumptions that turned out to be wrong; sizing that drifted.
3. **What lessons land where?** For each lesson: pick canonical / project-context / ADR per the preferences above.
4. **What deferred work surfaced?** Genuinely-deferred *scope* — slices/features pushed out of the project (typically tracked in `projects/<project>/deferred.md`) that should become Linear tickets vs items that should just be discarded.
5. **What's the ADR-worthy decision (if any)?** Not every project has one; many do.
6. **What's the one-sentence summary for the team channel?** A retro that doesn't get communicated to the wider team is half-landed.

**A retro collects *process* findings, not code-review findings.** The retro is about how the work was *delivered* — protocol failures, calibration drift, surprises, reviewer/dispatch discipline. Code-review NITs (deferrable lint-level findings, "add a real-rollback test", "handle ENOENT more cleanly", redundant fields) are **not retro material**: they belong in the slice's `code-review.md`, the PR thread, or a follow-up Linear ticket, and they're dispositioned there. Do not enumerate them in the retro or treat "what deferred work surfaced?" (prompt 4) as a place to relist them — that prompt is for deferred *scope*, not for review nits.

## Retro-trigger frequency baselines

- Healthy team: ~1 retro per slice (on average), most fired as dispatch-failure or drift triggers.
- Mature team on a stable subsystem: < 1 retro per slice, fired mostly on surprise / scope-shift triggers.
- New domain / first project in a subsystem: 2-3 retros per slice, mostly on calibration surprises. Expected; the lessons are populating the project-context surfaces.

If retros stop firing for weeks: check whether (a) the team's actually triggering them when triggers hit OR (b) the project is genuinely going so smoothly that no triggers fire. The second is rare.
