        Thanks for taking the time to report a bug! 🙏

        To help us address your issue as quickly as possible, please fill out all relevant sections in this template.

        The **most important** thing you can do is include a minimal reproduction of the issue.

        Easy ways to create a reproduction:
        - Create a CodeSandbox ([here are templates](https://codesandbox.io/examples/package/prisma))
        - A **GitHub repository** we can clone
        - As a last resort, detailed step-by-step instructions (this makes debugging harder for us)

        We receive a _lot_ of GitHub issues. **Bug reports without a reproduction might not be investigated.**

        💡 If you're trying to ask a question rather than file a bug report, try a GitHub Discussion instead or join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/prisma-937751382725886062).
