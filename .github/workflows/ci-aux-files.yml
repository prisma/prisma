jobs:
  # A job named "Detect jobs to run" is a required check for merging PRs. Without this workflow,
  # which only runs for the files ignored by `test.yml` workflow and contains a stub job with this name,
  # no PRs that only contain changes in these files could be merged. It exists to ensure the required
  # check still exists when the files ignored by `test.yml` are updated, even though it does nothing.
  #
  # In the future, this workflow can be extended to actually do something useful for these files
  # (e.g., run type checking and linting for the code in `sandbox/` and `scripts/`, check spelling in
  # markdown files, etc.).
