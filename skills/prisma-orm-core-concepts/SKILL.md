  Use whenever working with Prisma 8 (Prisma Next) — writing queries, editing
  the schema / data contract, running prisma CLI commands, wiring the runtime,
  debugging errors, or otherwise developing against the database. Does not
  apply to Prisma ORM 7 or earlier (schema.prisma + @prisma/client projects).

# Prisma Next (Prisma 8)

> **Edit your data contract. Prisma handles the rest.**

Prisma 8 moves fast, and your training data about it is very likely outdated. This skill ships inside the installed Prisma packages, so it describes the exact version this project has — treat it and its reference files as the source of truth, over anything you remember about Prisma. If `metadata.library_version` in this file's frontmatter does not match the project's installed Prisma packages, run `prisma skills sync` and re-read. Additional documentation for the wider Prisma platform lives at <https://www.prisma.io/docs>.

This skill routes every Prisma Next task to the right reference file — open the reference before writing code; do not answer from this file alone. The references teach concepts, structures, and workflows, not the full CLI surface: for flag-level detail on any individual command, run it with `--help`.

## The canonical model (one paragraph)

You author a **data contract** (a `contract.prisma` file, or a TypeScript builder). The framework emits machine-readable artifacts (`contract.json`, `contract.d.ts`) and gives you two runtime surfaces on SQL targets: a typed SQL query builder (`db.sql.<ns>.<table>`) and a typed ORM client (`db.orm.<ns>.<Model>`). On MongoDB targets only the ORM lane exists, and its keys are collection storage names (`db.orm.users`) rather than PSL model names — [`references/queries.md`](references/queries.md) § *MongoDB ORM addressing* covers the rule. Every query compiles to a **plan** before execution, and the database carries a **marker** naming the contract hash it satisfies. Migrations are planned from the contract diff; the `prisma-orm-migrations` skill owns that flow.

Three steps the user does:

1. **Edit your data contract.** ([`references/contract.md`](references/contract.md))
2. **The system plans the migrations for you.** (`prisma-orm-migrations` skill)
3. **If you need data migrations, you edit `migration.ts` and execute it.** (`prisma-orm-migrations` skill)

Everything else — queries, runtime wiring, build integration, upgrades, debugging, feedback — sits on top of those three.

## Routing table

Open the reference whose triggers match the task. If more than one matches, open each — they are written to compose.

## Routing rules

If the task clearly matches a row, open that reference directly without asking.

For a vague prompt, ask **one** disambiguating question. Pick from:

- *"Are you new to Prisma Next and asking what you can do with it, or where to start?"* → [`references/quickstart.md`](references/quickstart.md) (first-touch orientation path).
- *"Do you want to set up a new Prisma Next project, or wire it into an existing database?"* → [`references/quickstart.md`](references/quickstart.md).
- *"Do you want to edit your data contract (add a model / field / relation), or work with the database (migrations, queries)?"* → [`references/contract.md`](references/contract.md) vs the others.
- *"Is this about wiring Prisma Next into your build tool (Vite / Next.js / …), or about wiring `db.ts` and middleware at runtime?"* → [`references/build.md`](references/build.md) vs [`references/runtime.md`](references/runtime.md).
- *"What error or symptom are you seeing?"* → [`references/failure-modes.md`](references/failure-modes.md).
- *"Do you want to report this as a bug to the Prisma Next team, or is this a feature request?"* → [`references/feedback.md`](references/feedback.md).
- *"Is the project you want to upgrade an application, or a Prisma extension package?"* → [`references/upgrade-app.md`](references/upgrade-app.md) vs [`references/upgrade-extension.md`](references/upgrade-extension.md).

If you still can't tell which reference applies, ask the user what they want to do. Do not guess.

## Related skills

Planning, authoring, reviewing, or applying migrations — `db update`, `migration plan`, `db migrate`, refs, deploy review, `MIGRATION.*` codes — is owned by the sibling `prisma-orm-migrations` skill; the two install together.

## Checklist

- [ ] If the task matches a routing-table row, open that reference before writing code.
- [ ] If the prompt is vague, ask one disambiguating question.
- [ ] Do not attempt to answer from this file alone — the references carry the verified tool surface.
- [ ] If the user describes a missing feature or a misbehaviour they want fixed, open [`references/feedback.md`](references/feedback.md).
- [ ] If the task is migration planning / applying / review, route to `prisma-orm-migrations`.
