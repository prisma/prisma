    summary: |
      PostgreSQL temporal columns no longer read as JavaScript `Date`. Each of `date`,
      `timestamp(p)`, `timestamptz(p)` and `time(p)` now offers two explicit representations,
      and five codecs were removed with no compatibility aliases:

      | Retired | Replace with (Temporal) | Replace with (text) |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `pg/date@1` | `Date` → `pg/date-temporal@1` (`Temporal.PlainDate`) | `DateString` |
      | `pg/timestamp@1` | `Timestamp(p)` → `pg/timestamp-temporal@1` (`Temporal.PlainDateTime`) | `TimestampString(p)` |
      | `pg/timestamptz@1` | `Timestamptz(p)` → `pg/timestamptz-temporal@1` (`Temporal.Instant`) | `TimestamptzString(p)` |
      | `pg/time@1` | `Time(p)` → `pg/time-temporal@1` (`Temporal.PlainTime`) | `TimeString(p)` |
      | `sql/timestamp@1` (`field.timestamp()`) | `Timestamptz(p)` or `field.temporal.timestamptz(p)` | `TimestamptzString(p)` |

      1. **Decide a representation per column.** The bare PSL spellings (`Date`, `Timestamp`,
         `Timestamptz`, `Time`) keep working and now select the Temporal-backed codec. If a
         column's values should stay text — because your code treats them as strings, or
         because they include values Temporal cannot denote (`infinity`, non-ISO `DateStyle`
         output, years beyond ±271821) — rename the type to its `*String` spelling. Note
         `pg/time@1` already handed back a `string`: a `time` column whose value you treat as
         text needs `TimeString(p)`, not `Time(p)`.
      2. **Replace `field.timestamp()`.** The generic cross-target helper and its
         `sql/timestamp@1` codec are gone. On PostgreSQL use `field.temporal.timestamptz(p)`
         (or `field.temporal.timestamptzString(p)`), or the bare `Timestamptz(p)` type.
      3. **Repoint any codec id you wrote by hand.** Ids appear in raw-lane return
         declarations (``db.raw.sql`now()`.returns('pg/timestamptz@1')``), in
         `prepare({ id })`, and in hand-built contracts. A retired id no longer resolves and
         fails contract validation rather than degrading silently.
      4. **Re-emit every contract.** `prisma contract emit` rewrites `contract.json` and
         `contract.d.ts` together; the generated application types are where the new
         representation becomes visible. Commit the regenerated artifacts. A contract emitted
         before this release references a codec the registry cannot resolve and is rejected at
         runtime.
      5. **Provide a Temporal implementation if you kept any Temporal-backed column.** Prisma
         bundles no polyfill. Where the runtime has no native `Temporal`, install a global one
         in your entry point before any query runs — `import 'temporal-polyfill/full/global';`.
         Take `full/global`, not `global`: the default build omits non-ISO calendars and its
         published types resolve to `export {}`, so TypeScript will not see the namespace.
         **Every read** of a Temporal-backed column needs it, and so does any insert into a
         table carrying `temporal.updatedAt()`, whose generated value is a `Temporal.Instant`.
         Without it the operation fails with `RUNTIME.TEMPORAL_UNAVAILABLE`, which names the
         codec and recommends the matching `*String` type. A contract whose temporal columns
         are all `*String` needs no Temporal anywhere.
      6. **Update application code that consumed a `Date`.** `Temporal.Instant.from()` parses
         **only an ISO string carrying an offset** — it throws on a `Date`, on an
         epoch-millisecond number, and on a date-time string with no offset. Convert by source:

         | You have | Use |
         | --- | --- |
         | a `Date` | `instant = date.toTemporalInstant()`, or `Temporal.Instant.fromEpochMilliseconds(date.getTime())` |
         | epoch milliseconds | `Temporal.Instant.fromEpochMilliseconds(ms)` |
         | an ISO string **with** an offset (`…Z`, `…+02:00`) | `Temporal.Instant.from(text)` |
         | an ISO string **without** an offset | pick the zone it meant: `Temporal.PlainDateTime.from(text).toZonedDateTime('UTC').toInstant()` |
         | "now" | `Temporal.Now.instant()` |

         Match the column, not just the type name: a `date` column takes a
         `Temporal.PlainDate` (`Temporal.PlainDate.from('2024-01-01')`), a `timestamp` column a
         `Temporal.PlainDateTime`, a `time` column a `Temporal.PlainTime`. Only `timestamptz`
         takes an `Instant`.

         `Temporal.Instant.compare(a, b)` replaces `a.getTime() - b.getTime()`, but **both
         operands must already be `Instant`s** — it throws on a `Date`. Values read back from
         the ORM already are; convert anything you brought from elsewhere first.

         In tests, be careful with **`toMatchObject`**. A Temporal value has no own enumerable
         properties — every accessor lives on the prototype — so a subset matcher finds nothing
         to compare and passes for *any* value of the same type. `toEqual` is not affected
         (Vitest compares these correctly), but `toMatchObject` will silently stop checking the
         timestamp. Where you need a subset match, compare `toString()` or use the type's own
         `equals` / `compare`.

  - id: literal-default-needs-the-string-spelling
    summary: |
      A literal `@default(...)` on a Temporal-backed temporal column cannot be emitted today.
      The default value is encoded through the column's codec while the contract is being
      emitted, inside the CLI's own process, and on a runtime without a global `Temporal`
      implementation the encoding fails. So

      ```prisma
      occurredAt Timestamptz @default("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")
      ```

      fails `prisma contract emit` with `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED` and "this runtime has no
      global Temporal implementation".

      Use the string spelling for a column that needs a literal default:

      ```prisma
      occurredAt TimestamptzString @default("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")
      ```

      Function defaults are unaffected — `@default(now())` lowers to a PostgreSQL `now()`
      storage default, never passes through a codec, and works on either representation.

    summary: |
      `prisma orm init` no longer installs agent skills: the GitHub fetch (`npx skills add`)
      is removed and nothing inside `orm init` replaces it. Agent-skills setup belongs to the
      family-level `prisma init` command. The `--skip-skills` flag is removed with the
      behavior it opted out of. Existing projects keep whatever skills they already have;
      only scripts that invoke `orm init` and expect it to deliver skills (or pass
      `--skip-skills`) need to change.

    summary: |
      The emitted `contract.json` / `contract.d.ts` embed the toolchain version, which moves
      to 8.0.0-rc.6. Run `contract emit` once after upgrading so the emitted artifacts match
      the installed toolchain. The restamp is independent of the other changes in this
      release.

# 8.0.0-rc.5 → 8.0.0-rc.6 — User upgrade instructions

# PostgreSQL temporal representations

Both entries are schema-and-code renames; there is no codemod, because the choice between the
Temporal and the string representation is per column and only you know which values a column
holds. Work through the schema first, re-emit, then let the generated `contract.d.ts` types drive
the application-code changes — the compiler will point at every site whose value type moved.

Two behaviours are worth knowing before you choose. A Temporal codec rejects what `Temporal` cannot
denote — `infinity`, years beyond roughly ±271821, and output rendered under a non-ISO `DateStyle` —
naming the `*String` type that reads the same column losslessly. And a nested read returns the same
text a flat read does, because temporal expressions are cast to `text` before PostgreSQL builds the
JSON, which means both reflect the session `TimeZone`.

## `orm-init-no-longer-installs-agent-skills`

Nothing to change in an existing project: skills already on disk stay as they are. Walk every `orm init` invocation the detection finds (a mention in prose that is not a command needs no action):

- An invocation passing `--skip-skills`: drop the flag — it no longer exists and the invocation fails with an unknown-flag error. The behavior it opted out of is gone, so the flagless invocation is the equivalent.
- A plain invocation with no flag: the scaffold itself is unchanged, but it no longer installs agent skills. If the script (or the person following it) relied on that, run `prisma init` in the project afterwards; that command owns skills setup now. If skills were incidental, no change is needed.

## `contract-artifacts-restamp`

For every `contract.json` matched by `detection`, run the project's emit command (`prisma contract emit`, or the project's `contract:emit` script) once after upgrading. The only expected diff is the embedded `version` moving to `8.0.0-rc.6`.
