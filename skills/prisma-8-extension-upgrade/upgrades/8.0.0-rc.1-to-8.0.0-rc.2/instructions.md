  - id: check-constraint-ir-carries-an-opaque-expression
    summary: |
      `CheckConstraint` (contract IR) and `SqlCheckConstraintIR` (schema IR) changed from
      `{ name, column, valueSet }` / `{ name, column, permittedValues }` to
      `{ name, prefix?, expression }`. Both are constructed from an `SqlObjectNaming` rather
      than a bare name, exactly like `Index` / `SqlIndexIR`: pass
      `{ naming: { kind: 'wire', prefix, hash }, expression }` for a managed check, or
      `{ naming: { kind: 'exact', name }, expression }` for one adopted verbatim. Compute the
      hash with `computeCheckContentHash(expression)` from `@internal/sql-schema-ir/naming`.
      Reading a check off a built node is unchanged (`check.name`), and `check.prefix` tells
      you whether it is wire-named. Contract JSON hydrates through
      `checkConstraintInputFromSerialized`, which rejects a `prefix` that does not parse out of
      the `name`. `resolveValueSetValues` is gone — a check no longer references a value set,
      so there is nothing to resolve; the members are already baked into the predicate text.

      `AddCheckConstraintCall` is now constructed as

      parameters are gone, and the rendered DDL is
      `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT "x" CHECK (<expression>)` with the predicate emitted
      verbatim. The matching migration-class method takes
      `{ schema, table, constraint, expression }`. `DropCheckConstraintCall` is unchanged.

    summary: |
      The options bag on `typescriptContract` / `typescriptContractFromPath` now requires
      `createNamespace` alongside `defaultControlPolicy`. Stamping a specifier default carries
      a consequence — derived CHECK constraints are stripped from tables the stamped policy
      leaves non-managed — and the strip rebuilds storage namespaces through the target's
      factory, so the two options travel together. Pass the same factory the PSL specifier
      already takes:
      `typescriptContract(contract, output, { defaultControlPolicy: 'external' })` becomes
      `typescriptContract(contract, output, { defaultControlPolicy: 'external',
      createNamespace: postgresCreateNamespace })`, with `postgresCreateNamespace` imported
      from the Postgres target's types entrypoint (`@internal/target-postgres/types`).
      Calls without an options bag are unchanged, and `emptyContract` already took
      `createNamespace`.

    summary: |
      Run your extension's `contract emit` (the `build:contract-space` script, if you have one)
      to regenerate its committed `contract.json` / `contract.d.ts`. Two things change: any
      enum CHECK is re-serialized into the new shape with a wire name, and every list (`many`)
      column gains a declared element-non-null CHECK that the Postgres planner used to
      synthesize without ever declaring. Prefixes derived from long table and column names are
      truncated to 54 UTF-8 bytes so the wire name fits Postgres's 63-byte identifier limit;
      identity lives in the hash, so truncated prefixes still yield distinct names.
      Postgres introspection also stopped parsing predicates and now captures every CHECK
      constraint verbatim, so any hand-written or platform-installed check on a table your
      extension manages is visible for the first time: it verifies as an undeclared extra under
      `--strict` and becomes a `dropCheckConstraint` under a policy that allows `destructive`.
      If your extension installs checks out of band — through a raw-SQL migration step rather
      than through the contract — there is no way to declare them in 8.0.0-rc.2 (checks have no
      authoring surface, and derivation from column shape is not one). Keep the tables carrying
      them under an additive-only policy — the checks survive, and only `--strict` verify
      reports them — or expect the first destructive plan against an upgraded database to
      offer to drop them. An authoring/opt-out surface is planned for a later release.

      registry whose `values()` yields nothing produces a collection and a `sql()` function bag
      with no aggregate methods at all — `TypeError: aggregate.count is not a function` at the
      first call. A `resolve()` that answers `count` is no longer sufficient on its own: `resolve`
      settles one `(operation, input)` pair, `values` declares the vocabulary. Prefer
      `buildSqlAggregateDescriptorRegistry(descriptors, codecDescriptors)` from

      The ORM's `aggregate()` / `groupBy().aggregate()` / `groupBy().having()` builders, the
      include reducers on a collection, and the SQL builder's aggregate functions no longer
      declare `count` / `sum` / `avg` / `min` / `max` outright. Each surface is a mapped type over
      the operation names in the contract's emitted `AggregateTypes` block. Deriving the surface
      neither adds nor removes a method by itself, but the block a re-emit produces is not the
      list it was: PostgreSQL now declares eight operations and SQLite seven, and the bare results
      over integer columns moved — `count`, `sum`, and `avg`. What stayed: `min` / `max`, `sum`
      and `avg` over a float, `numeric`, `interval`, or `time` column, and `sum` over an
      `UnboundedInt` column, each still in its own family — see

      A contract whose block is unknown — an in-code `defineContract(...)` value, or a
      contract emitted before `AggregateTypes` existed — resolves every one of those surfaces to
      `AggregateOperationsUnavailable`, an empty type, so the call fails with
      `Property 'count' does not exist` rather than offering selector types the declaration
      cannot supply. This is a compile-time change only: the runtime builds its methods from the
      composed registry and dispatches exactly as before. Either emit the contract and type the
      client from the emitted `Contract`, or cast the builder to a dynamic record — see the body

      both a `withoutInput` row and an `anyInput` row, so the derived method carries both arities
      honestly: `count()` counts rows, `count(field)` counts that field's non-null values. Typed
      call sites are unaffected, because `count` took no argument before and no such call
      compiled. Reachable through a call that bypassed the types — a `@ts-expect-error`, an
      `as never` argument, or dynamic invocation. Those call sites change result whenever the
      column holds NULLs. Sweep them and drop the argument wherever `COUNT(*)` was what you meant.

      An aggregate descriptor whose `operation` is not one of `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`

      outside that alphabet was inert — no consumer surface offered it. It is live now: a
      contributed operation surfaces as a method on the ORM and SQL-builder aggregate surfaces
      under its own name, so it must be able to build an expression, and the closed AST alphabet
      gives it none. Registry assembly rejects a hook-less descriptor with
      `RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_LOWERING_MISSING` while the execution context composes. Two further
      rules follow. An out-of-alphabet operation is projection-only: HAVING, ORDER BY, and
      comparison operands refuse it with `ORM.AGGREGATE_PROJECTION_ONLY`, and its typed HAVING
      method does not exist. And its name may not shadow an ORM collection member (`select`,
      `where`, `include`, `combine`, `state`, …), because reducers install into that same

    summary: |
      Both built-in targets split their aggregate vocabulary. `count()`, `sum()` over an integer
      input, and `avg()` over an integer input read as `number` — where they read as a `bigint`,
      a `bigint`-or-decimal-string, and a decimal string. Three new operations carry the lossless
      results: `countBigInt` → `bigint`, `sumBigInt` → `bigint` (over `pg/int8@1`,
      `pg/int8number@1`, and `pg/unboundedint@1` it resolves to `pg/unboundedint@1`, exact past
      2^63), and `avgDecimal` → `pg/numeric@1`, PostgreSQL only. `count`'s empty-input answer is
      `0`, not `0n`. `count`, and `sum` over an integer input, raise `RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED` past
      ±(2^53 − 1) rather than rounding, on the JSON/include path as well as the wire path; no
      other result carries that guard, `avg` included. Unchanged: `min`/`max`,
      `sum`/`avg` over float codecs, `sum` over `pg/numeric@1` and `pg/unboundedint@1`, and the
      ORM's `having(...)` operands, which its typed surface fixes at `number`. The SQL builder's
      comparison operands do move: `fns.gt` types both sides from one codec, so
      `fns.gt(fns.count(), 1n)` becomes `fns.gt(fns.count(), 1)`.
      Two things to do. Re-run your contract space's `contract emit` —
      the `AggregateTypes` block gains the three operations and the changed result codecs. Then
      fix pack tests that assert aggregate values or rendered SQL: `2n` and decimal-string
      expectations become plain numbers, and PostgreSQL's integer `avg` renders
      `CAST(avg(…) AS float8)` where it rendered a plain `avg(…)`. SQLite's transport cast to
      text is unchanged, but `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` now carries a JSON projection
      (`CAST(… AS INTEGER)`), so a SQLite include aggregate arrives inside `json_object` as a
      JSON number rather than a JSON string.

      A descriptor with `nullable: false` must also declare `emptyResultJson` — the value the

      during emit). State the value in the **result codec's canonical JSON**, not as an
      application value: `emptyResultJson: 0` under `pg/int8number@1`, `emptyResultJson: '0'`
      under `pg/int8@1`. The empty-input answer belongs to the operation rather than to the codec
      — `count`'s identity element is zero, an `every()`'s would be `true` — which is why it sits
      on the descriptor. `ResolvedSqlAggregate` (`@internal/sql-relational-core/query-lane-context`)

      used to accept a number and stringify it, which let a fractional value through to an
      integer column. `encodeJson` is deliberately wider on the exact codecs: it accepts a

      `BigInt @default(0)` arrives as the JSON number `0`; a non-integral or unsafe number raises
      `<codec> number literal must be an integer within the safe integer range`. Two consequences
      for a pack. Any place you hand a codec a value read out of a contract, JSON, or PSL must
      pick the matching method — `encode` takes the application value, `encodeJson` takes and
      returns canonical JSON. And if your pack renders DDL literal defaults itself, read the
      stored value back first: `await codec.encode(codec.decodeJson(stored), {})`, which is the

# 8.0.0-rc.1 → 8.0.0-rc.2 — Extension-author upgrade instructions

## `stub-execution-contexts-must-carry-an-aggregate-registry`

The aggregate method sets are built by enumerating the composed registry, once per `Collection` construction and once at `orm(...)`. A test that fabricates an `ExecutionContext` therefore has to supply one:

```ts
import { buildSqlAggregateDescriptorRegistry } from '@internal/sql-relational-core/aggregate-descriptor-registry';

const context = {
  contract,
  codecDescriptors,
  aggregateDescriptors: buildSqlAggregateDescriptorRegistry(descriptors, codecDescriptors),
  // …
};
```

Two distinct failures tell you which half is missing:

- **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'values')`**, thrown from `new Collection(...)` or `orm(...)` — the stub has no `aggregateDescriptors` field at all.
- **`TypeError: aggregate.count is not a function`** (or `posts.count is not a function`, or `fns.sum is not a function`) — the stub has a registry, but its `values()` yields nothing, so no method was installed. `resolve()` alone no longer describes the surface: `resolve` settles one `(operation, input)` pair on demand, `values` declares which operations exist.

A minimal hand-written stub that keeps `count` available:

```ts
const aggregateDescriptors = {
  resolve: (operation: string) =>
    operation === 'count'
      ? {
          operation,
          output: { codecId: 'pg/int8@1' },
          nullable: false as const,
          emptyResultJson: '0',
          lower: undefined,
        }
      : undefined,
  values: function* () {
    yield {
      operation: 'count',
      input: { kind: 'any' as const },
      output: { kind: 'codec' as const, codecId: 'pg/int8@1' },
      nullable: false as const,
      emptyResultJson: '0',
    };
  },
};
```

`emptyResultJson` is required on any non-nullable row — see [`non-nullable-aggregate-descriptors-declare-an-empty-result`](#non-nullable-aggregate-descriptors-declare-an-empty-result) for what the value means and which form to state it in.

Prefer the real builder where the test can afford it — it applies the same validation the runtime does, including the lowering rule below.

## `aggregate-surfaces-derive-from-the-contract-s-operation-map`

Every aggregate surface is now a mapped type keyed by the operation names in the contract's emitted `AggregateTypes` block:

| Surface | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `collection.aggregate(fn)` | `AggregateBuilder<TContract, ModelName, NsId>` |
| `groupBy(...).aggregate(fn)` | the same |
| `groupBy(...).having(fn)` | `HavingBuilder<…>` — keyed by the map *intersected with* the SQL alphabet |
| `include('rel', (rel) => …)` | `AggregateIncludeReducers<…>` on the collection |
| `sql().select((f, fns) => …)` | `AggregateOnlyFunctions<QC>` |

For a contract emitted by `prisma-next contract emit` on 8.0.0-rc.1 or later, the derivation itself takes nothing away — the block names whatever the composed stack declares. It does not name the same list it did, though: PostgreSQL now declares eight operations and SQLite seven, and the bare results over integer columns moved — `count`, `sum`, and `avg`. `min` / `max` did not, nor did `sum` and `avg` over a float, `numeric`, `interval`, or `time` column, nor `sum` over an `UnboundedInt` column; each of those stays in its own family. Re-emit, then work the two entries that carry those changes — [`count-over-a-field-counts-that-field`](#count-over-a-field-counts-that-field) and [`aggregate-defaults-are-js-native-numbers`](#aggregate-defaults-are-js-native-numbers).

For a contract whose block is unknown, all five surfaces resolve to `AggregateOperationsUnavailable` — an empty interface carrying one optional symbol-keyed brand that names the reason on hover. Two populations reach it:

- a contract built in code with `defineContract(...)` and used without emission (fixtures, integration tests, the no-emit authoring flow);
- a contract emitted before `AggregateTypes` existed, i.e. before 8.0.0-rc.1.

The symptom is a compile error at the call site:

```text
Property 'count' does not exist on type 'AggregateOperationsUnavailable'.
```

Runtime behaviour is unchanged — the methods are installed from the composed registry either way — so a cast is a legitimate fix where the contract is deliberately un-emitted:

```ts
import type { AggregateSpec } from '@internal/sql-orm-client';

type DynamicAggregates = Record<string, (field?: string) => AggregateSpec[string]>;

const stats = await readings.aggregate((aggregate) => {
  const dynamic = aggregate as DynamicAggregates;
  return { total: dynamic['sum']!('counter'), peak: dynamic['max']!('counter') };
});
```

The same shape works for an include reducer, whose callback receives the refinement collection:

```ts
const reduceToTotal = (related: unknown): unknown =>
  (related as DynamicAggregates)['sum']!('counter');

await readings.select('id').include('samples', (samples) => reduceToTotal(samples) as never).all();
```

Where an argument was previously widened past the types — `aggregate.sum('counter' as never)` compiled because `AggregateFieldNames` was already `never` for such a contract — the cast moves from the argument to the builder, and the field name goes back to being a plain string.

The better fix, wherever the pack can emit, is to emit: run `prisma-next contract emit` and type the client from the emitted `Contract`. That restores full typing — arities, admitted field names, and per-codec result types — instead of erasing it.

## `count-over-a-field-counts-that-field`

`count(field)` counts that field:

```ts
await db.orm.User.aggregate((aggregate) => ({ all: aggregate.count() }));
// SELECT COUNT(*) …

await db.orm.User.aggregate((aggregate) => ({ named: aggregate.count('email') }));
// SELECT COUNT("email") … — rows whose email is NULL are not counted
```

The second call used to render `COUNT(*)`: the argument was accepted and discarded. It is honoured now, because both arities are read off `count`'s rows rather than special-cased — PostgreSQL declares `count` with `input: { kind: 'any' }`, which settles into a `withoutInput` row (the zero-argument call) and an `anyInput` row (the field-taking call).

No typed call site changes meaning, because the field-taking overload did not exist before. What to sweep for is a call that got past the types:

- `// @ts-expect-error` immediately above a `count(...)` call. Where the argument is a field the contract admits, the suppression is now unused and TypeScript reports the unused directive. Where it is not — a relation name, say — the directive still holds and the call still fails.
- `count(x as never)` or `count(x as any)`.
- dynamic dispatch through a `Record<string, …>` cast.

For each, decide which count you meant. `COUNT(*)` is `count()`; `COUNT(col)` skips NULLs.

## `contributed-aggregate-operations-carry-a-lowering-hook`

Aggregate operation names are an open vocabulary, and they now reach the consumer surfaces. The SQL alphabet holds exactly five names (`count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`), and a pack that contributes a descriptor named outside it — `bitOr`, say — gets a method under that name on the ORM's `aggregate()`, on `groupBy().aggregate()`, and on the include reducers, plus a matching function on the SQL builder. Three rules come with that.

**Declare a `lower` hook.** The AST's `AggregateExpr` carries only alphabet names, so a novel operation has no default form; the hook builds its whole expression from existing nodes:

```ts
import type { SqlAggregateDescriptor } from '@internal/sql-relational-core/aggregate-descriptor-registry';
import { FunctionCallExpr } from '@internal/sql-relational-core/ast';

const bitOr: SqlAggregateDescriptor = {
  operation: 'bitOr',
  input: { kind: 'codec', codecId: 'pg/int8@1' },
  output: { kind: 'codec', codecId: 'pg/int8@1' },
  nullable: true,
  lower: ({ expr }) => FunctionCallExpr.of('bit_or', expr === undefined ? [] : [expr]),
};
```

Without it, the execution context refuses to compose:

```text
RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_LOWERING_MISSING: Aggregate descriptor 'bitOr:codec:pg/int8@1' declares
operation 'bitOr', which is outside the SQL aggregate alphabet (count, sum, avg, min, max)
and carries no lowering hook.
```

**Use it in projections only.** The lowered form is a rendering for the driver boundary. HAVING, ORDER BY, and comparison operands compare inside the database, where that rendering would change what the comparison means, so both consumers refuse those positions at authoring time with `ORM.AGGREGATE_PROJECTION_ONLY`. The typed surface agrees: `HavingBuilder` is keyed by the map intersected with the alphabet, so a contributed operation has no HAVING method to call. Project it in a select and filter or order on the projected value.

**Pick a name no collection member owns.** Include reducers install into the ORM collection's own namespace, beside `select`, `where`, `include`, `combine`, `aggregate`, and the collection's instance fields. `orm(...)` rejects a collision with `ORM.AGGREGATE_OPERATION_RESERVED` and names the operation in `meta.operation`; rename the operation.

| `avg` | every PostgreSQL integer codec | `pg/float8@1`, through a result cast | `pg/numeric@1` |
| `avgDecimal` | every PostgreSQL integer codec, plus `pg/numeric@1` | `pg/numeric@1` | — (new) |

Everything else keeps its row: `min` / `max`, `sum` and `avg` over the float codecs, `sum` over `pg/numeric@1` and `pg/unboundedint@1`, `avg` over `pg/numeric@1` and `pg/interval@1`, and SQLite's `avg`, which was already `sqlite/real@1`.

`sumBigInt` over a 64-bit input resolves to `pg/unboundedint@1` rather than `pg/int8@1`, deliberately: PostgreSQL computes that total as a `numeric`, and casting it back to `int8` would raise `bigint out of range` past 2^63. On SQLite, `sumBigInt` is offered inside SQLite's own bound — a 64-bit `SUM` overflow raises `integer overflow` in the database rather than promoting to a float.

### What to do

1. **Re-run your contract space's `contract emit`.** The `AggregateTypes` block in the committed `contract.d.ts` gains `countBigInt`, `sumBigInt`, and `avgDecimal`, and the changed result codecs on `count` / `sum` / `avg`.
2. **Fix value assertions in pack tests.** `expect(stats.total).toBe(2n)` becomes `toBe(2)`; a decimal-string average expectation becomes a number. Where the test was proving exactness, change the *method* to the suffixed variant rather than the expectation.
3. **Fix rendered-SQL assertions on PostgreSQL `avg`.** An integer `avg` renders `CAST(avg("t"."c") AS float8)` where it rendered a plain `avg("t"."c")`. The cast is on the **result**, so the exact `numeric` mean is computed first and rounded once.
4. **Expect a JSON number from a SQLite include aggregate.** `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` carries a JSON projection (`CAST(… AS INTEGER)`), so an included `count` or `sum` arrives inside `json_object` as a JSON number rather than a JSON string. The transport cast to text on the flat path is unchanged.
5. **Retype SQL-builder comparison literals against an aggregate.** `fns.gt(a, b)` types both operands from one codec, so a literal compared against `fns.count()` or an integer `fns.sum(...)` follows the aggregate's new result codec: `fns.gt(fns.count(), 1n)` becomes `fns.gt(fns.count(), 1)`. The ORM's `having(...)` is not this case — its comparand is typed `number` outright.

`count`, and `sum` over an integer input, raise `RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED` past ±(2^53 − 1) rather than rounding, on the JSON path as well as the wire path — the guard runs after `JSON.parse`, and rounding is monotone, so a value outside the range cannot parse back inside it. They are the two results a guarded integer codec produces; `sum` over a float, `numeric`, or unbounded-integer input keeps that input's own family, and `avg` resolves to a float codec that rounds as any double does.

## `non-nullable-aggregate-descriptors-declare-an-empty-result`

A descriptor that declares `nullable: false` must declare `emptyResultJson` beside it:

```ts
import type { SqlAggregateDescriptor } from '@internal/sql-relational-core/aggregate-descriptor-registry';

const count: SqlAggregateDescriptor = {
  operation: 'count',
  input: { kind: 'any' },
  output: { kind: 'codec', codecId: 'pg/int8number@1' },
  nullable: false,
  emptyResultJson: 0,
};
```

`AggregateResultNullability` — exported from `@internal/framework-components/components` — is a discriminated union (`{ nullable: true } | { nullable: false; emptyResultJson: JsonValue }`), so `{ nullable: false }` alone is a type error. The runtime check agrees: registry assembly raises `RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID`, and `contract emit` raises `CONTRACT.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID`.

**State the value in the result codec's canonical JSON, not as an application value.** The client decodes it through the codec the same row declares, so the two must agree — and the wrong form only fails at the one moment a populated table never reaches. `count`'s zero is `0` under `pg/int8number@1` and `'0'` under `pg/int8@1`.

**Why it lives on the descriptor.** The empty-input answer is a property of the operation, not of the type its result carries: `count`'s identity element is zero, an `every()`'s would be `true`, a `product()`'s would be one. A codec has no way to know which.

The value is read only where no result row reaches the client at all — an absent aggregate alias, or an include whose envelope never arrived. SQL answers an ordinary empty input set itself.

If your pack consumes a resolution rather than contributing one, `ResolvedSqlAggregate` (`@internal/sql-relational-core/query-lane-context`) follows the same union. Reading `resolved.nullable` narrows as it always did; constructing one spreads the nullability instead of assigning a boolean:

```ts
const nullability = descriptor.nullable
  ? ({ nullable: true } as const)
  : ({ nullable: false, emptyResultJson: descriptor.emptyResultJson } as const);

return { operation, output, ...nullability, lower };
```

## `integer-codecs-check-the-js-type-they-are-given`

The integer codecs answer for the JS type before the range, so a wrong type reads as a wrong type:

```text
RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED: pg/int8@1 value must be a bigint, got number 9
RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED: pg/int8number@1 value must be a number, got bigint 9
```

`meta.received` names the type that arrived. `pg/int8@1`, `pg/unboundedint@1`, and `sqlite/bigint@1` read a `bigint`; `pg/int8number@1` and `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` read a `number`. The bigint codecs used to accept a number and stringify it, which meant `1.5` reached an integer column as valid decimal text.

**`encodeJson` is wider on the exact codecs, and only there.** It also accepts a safe-integer `number`, because a schema language writes no `bigint` literal — `BigInt @default(0)` arrives as the JSON number `0`. A non-integral or unsafe number is refused:

```text
RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED: pg/int8@1 number literal must be an integer within
the safe integer range, got 9007199254740992
```

Past that range the literal was already rounded before the codec saw it, so its digits no longer name the value that was written.

Two consequences for a pack:

- **Pick the method that matches the value you hold.** `encode` takes the application value and produces a wire value; `encodeJson` takes and returns canonical JSON. Handing canonical JSON to `encode` used to work for codecs whose two forms coincide and now fails loudly for the ones whose forms differ.
- **If your pack renders DDL literal defaults itself, read the stored value back first.** A contract stores a default in the codec's canonical JSON, so the pair is `decodeJson` then `encode`, in that order:

  ```ts
  const value = stored instanceof Date ? stored : codec.decodeJson(stored);
  const wire = await codec.encode(value, {});
  ```

  A `Date` is the one authored value JSON has no notation for, so it is the one that arrives as itself.

## Why checks stopped being structured

A check is now one opaque SQL string that nothing parses. Postgres reprints predicates in its
own normalized form — a `varchar` membership test comes back as
`((col)::text = ANY ((ARRAY[…])::text[]))` — so any structured reading of a live predicate
drifts against the authored text. Equality for a wire-named check is name equality, because the
hash already commits to the predicate; only an exact-named check compares its body, and then
byte-for-byte.
## If your target pack authors checks

Check emission is driven by a duck-typed `renderCheckExpressions` hook on the pack's
`authoring` contributions, resolved the same way `qualifyColumnType` is. It receives one
column's shape (`tableName`, `columnName`, `many`, and `memberValues` — the last present only
for a value set the toolchain owns) and returns `{ kind, columnName, expression }` candidates,
where `kind` is `'membership'` or `'elementNotNull'`. A pack without the hook emits no checks
at all, which is how SQLite keeps its no-CHECK stance. Nothing in the return value is a name:
the contract builder composes the prefix from the table, the column, and the kind, truncates it
to 54 UTF-8 bytes, and appends the content hash.
## Hand-written checks are visible now

Postgres introspection reads `pg_get_expr(c.conbin, c.conrelid)` and stores the predicate
verbatim; it no longer recognises only the two shapes the old parser could parse. Every CHECK
constraint on a managed table therefore reaches the differ, and one the contract does not
declare is an ordinary undeclared extra: reported by `db verify --strict`, and dropped by a plan
whose control policy allows `destructive`.

For an extension this matters in one specific case — a check your extension installs through a
raw-SQL migration step rather than deriving in its contract space. That constraint used to be
invisible and is now drop-eligible against any database the extension manages. Declaring it is
not possible in 8.0.0-rc.2: a contract space derives checks from column shape (enum membership,
list element-non-null) and has no surface for an arbitrary hand-written predicate. Document
that the tables carrying it stay under an additive-only policy — the check survives, plain
`db verify` tolerates it, and only `--strict` reports it — or accept the drop under a
destructive plan. An authoring/opt-out surface for checks is planned for a later release.
