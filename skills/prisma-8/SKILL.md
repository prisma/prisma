  Comprehensive guide for building with Prisma 8 (Prisma Next), the
  contract-first data layer. Use whenever working on Prisma code in a project
  that uses it — authoring or editing the data contract (contract.prisma, PSL,
  TypeScript builders), migrations, queries (db.orm / db.sql), runtime wiring
  (db.ts, middleware, DATABASE_URL), build-tool integration, Supabase / RLS,
  reading PN-* structured errors, or filing feedback — and for orientation
  questions like "what is Prisma Next" or comparisons to other ORMs. Signals
  that this skill applies: @internal/* imports, prisma.config.ts,
  contract.prisma / contract.json / contract.d.ts, the prisma-next CLI,
  PN-* error codes. Does not apply to Prisma ORM 7 or earlier
  (schema.prisma + @prisma/client projects).

# Prisma Next (Prisma 8)

> **Edit your data contract. Prisma handles the rest.**

Prisma Next is a contract-first data layer. This skill routes every Prisma Next task to the right reference file — open the reference before writing code; do not answer from this file alone.

## The canonical model (one paragraph)

You author a **data contract** (a `contract.prisma` file, or a TypeScript builder). The framework emits machine-readable artifacts (`contract.json`, `contract.d.ts`) and gives you two runtime surfaces on SQL targets: a typed SQL query builder (`db.sql.<ns>.<table>`) and a typed ORM client (`db.orm.<ns>.<Model>`). On MongoDB targets only the ORM lane exists, and its keys are collection storage names (`db.orm.users`) rather than PSL model names — [`references/queries.md`](references/queries.md) § *MongoDB ORM addressing* covers the rule. Migrations are planned from the contract diff; you review them, optionally edit the `migration.ts` for data transforms, and apply.

Three steps the user does:

1. **Edit your data contract.** ([`references/contract.md`](references/contract.md))
2. **The system plans the migrations for you.** ([`references/migrations.md`](references/migrations.md))
3. **If you need data migrations, you edit `migration.ts` and execute it.** ([`references/migrations.md`](references/migrations.md))

Everything else — queries, runtime wiring, build integration, debugging, feedback — sits on top of those three.

## Routing table

Open the reference whose triggers match the task. If more than one matches, open each — they are written to compose.

| Task | Reference | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| Adopt / set up / first steps | [`references/quickstart.md`](references/quickstart.md) | new project, existing database, "what can I do with Prisma Next", "where do I start", "just ran createprisma", `npx create-prisma`, first steps, first query, `prisma orm init` greenfield setup, `contract infer` + `db sign` brownfield adoption, connect-write-read first arc, day-to-day commands (`contract emit`, `db init`, `db update`, `migration plan`, `db migrate`, `db schema`, `db verify`), flags `--target` / `--authoring` / `--schema-path` / `--probe-db` / `--output` |

## Routing rules

If the task clearly matches a row, open that reference directly without asking.

For a vague prompt, ask **one** disambiguating question. Pick from:

- *"Are you new to Prisma Next and asking what you can do with it, or where to start?"* → [`references/quickstart.md`](references/quickstart.md) (first-touch orientation path).
- *"Do you want to set up a new Prisma Next project, or wire it into an existing database?"* → [`references/quickstart.md`](references/quickstart.md).
- *"Do you want to edit your data contract (add a model / field / relation), or work with the database (migrations, queries)?"* → [`references/contract.md`](references/contract.md) vs the others.
- *"Is this about authoring a migration, or about reviewing what's going to run on deploy?"* → [`references/migrations.md`](references/migrations.md) vs [`references/migration-review.md`](references/migration-review.md).
- *"Is this about wiring Prisma Next into your build tool (Vite / Next.js / …), or about wiring `db.ts` and middleware at runtime?"* → [`references/build.md`](references/build.md) vs [`references/runtime.md`](references/runtime.md).
- *"What error or symptom are you seeing?"* → [`references/debug.md`](references/debug.md).
- *"Do you want to report this as a bug to the Prisma Next team, or is this a feature request?"* → [`references/feedback.md`](references/feedback.md).

If you still can't tell which reference applies, ask the user what they want to do. Do not guess.

## Checklist

- [ ] If the task matches a routing-table row, open that reference before writing code.
- [ ] If the prompt is vague, ask one disambiguating question.
- [ ] Do not attempt to answer from this file alone — the references carry the verified tool surface.
- [ ] If the user describes a missing feature or a misbehaviour they want fixed, open [`references/feedback.md`](references/feedback.md).
