# 8.0.0-rc.9 → 8.0.0-rc.10 — User upgrade instructions

## `params-only-sql-facade-prepare`

Find calls to `prepare(declaration, callback)` on clients created by the Postgres or SQLite facade (`@prisma/orm-postgres/runtime`, `@prisma/orm-sqlite/runtime`, or their `@internal/postgres/runtime` and `@internal/sqlite/runtime` counterparts). Resolve the receiver and callback rather than rewriting every method named `prepare`: native SQLite `database.prepare(sql)` and SQL runtime's existing params-only preparation are different APIs and must remain unchanged.

Change callbacks from `(sql, params) => ...` to `(params) => ...`. Replace references bound to the removed `sql` callback argument with the same facade receiver's lexical `.sql` property. Preserve the params argument's name, declaration, SQL chain, row selection, filters and invocation target/options. For extracted callbacks, capture the same client in the enclosing scope; do not capture an invocation target or evaluate the callback twice. Update explicit callback type annotations to accept only the placeholder-params argument.

```ts
// Before
const query = await db.prepare({ id: 'pg/int4@1' }, (sql, params) =>
  sql.public.users.select('id').where((f, fns) => fns.eq(f.id, params.id)).build(),
);

// After
const query = await db.prepare({ id: 'pg/int4@1' }, (params) =>
  db.sql.public.users.select('id').where((f, fns) => fns.eq(f.id, params.id)).build(),
);
```

Apply the same translation to SQLite's flat SQL facade (`sql.users` becomes `db.sql.users`), retaining its existing codec ids. Keep `.query(target, params, options?)` and SQL statistics `.execute(target, params, options?)` calls unchanged. Do not rewrite historical release notes, applied upgrade recipes, generated contracts or tests as part of this source translation.
