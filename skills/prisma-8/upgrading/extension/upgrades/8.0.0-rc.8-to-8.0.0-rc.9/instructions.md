changes:
  - id: remove-nested-relations-from-sql-orm-upsert-and-batch-create
    summary: |
      SQL ORM `upsert({ create })`, `createAll()`, and `createAndCount()` payloads no longer accept nested relation mutation callbacks, which these operations cannot execute. Remove the callbacks and create related records separately, or use ordinary `create()` when the records must be created as one nested relation operation.
  - id: namespace-qualify-sql-orm-filter-types
    summary: |
      SQL ORM reusable filter types now require the domain namespace before the model name: `<Contract, Namespace, Model>`.
  - id: postgres-list-element-codecs-receive-raw-strings
    summary: |
      PostgreSQL list decoding now parses array frames in the target and passes raw string elements to the scalar element codec; custom PostgreSQL codecs used in lists must accept those raw element spellings.

# 8.0.0-rc.8 → 8.0.0-rc.9 — Extension author upgrade instructions

## `remove-nested-relations-from-sql-orm-upsert-and-batch-create`

Find SQL ORM calls to `upsert()`, `createAll()`, and `createAndCount()` whose create payloads contain relation fields assigned callback functions. Remove those callbacks and create the related records separately. When the operation requires nested relation creation, replace it with ordinary `create()`, which continues to accept and execute relation mutation callbacks.

## `namespace-qualify-sql-orm-filter-types`

Find TypeScript references to `ShorthandWhereFilter`, `RelationPredicate`, `RelationPredicateInput`, and `RelationFilterAccessor`. Add the model's domain namespace as the second generic argument and place the model name third. Rewrite `ShorthandWhereFilter<Contract, Model>` as `ShorthandWhereFilter<Contract, Namespace, Model>` and `ShorthandWhereFilter<Contract, Model, Namespace>` as `ShorthandWhereFilter<Contract, Namespace, Model>`. Rewrite the relation types from `<Contract, Model>` to `<Contract, Namespace, Model>`. For predicates targeting a relation, use the namespace declared by that relation's `to.namespace` coordinate.

## `postgres-list-element-codecs-receive-raw-strings`

Review PostgreSQL extension codecs whose descriptors can be used by `CodecRef.many` list columns. Inbound list framing is now target-owned: the target parses the Postgres array literal and invokes the scalar element codec for each non-null raw string element. Keep scalar direct-query compatibility as needed, but make the element `decode(wire, ctx)` accept the raw text spelling Postgres emits for that scalar value; the built-in numeric, boolean, integer, and float codecs accept both raw strings and native scalar wire values for this reason. Do not add a native-array fallback at the list-frame boundary, and do not add compatibility exports or codec-id aliases. `codecId`, `typeParams`, and emitted `CodecRef.many` shapes are unchanged.
