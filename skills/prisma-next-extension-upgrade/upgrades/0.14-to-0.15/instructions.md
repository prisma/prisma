    summary: |
      The SQL family no longer materialises a placeholder namespace, so authoring a SQL contract now
      requires a target namespace factory. If your extension builds a contract via `prismaContract(...)`
      or `defineContract(...)` from `@prisma-next/sql-contract-psl` / `@prisma-next/sql-contract-ts`
      (rather than through a target pack's own `defineContract` wrapper, which already supplies it),
      pass the now-required `createNamespace` option: `postgresCreateNamespace` from
      `@prisma-next/target-postgres/types`, or `sqliteCreateNamespace` from `@prisma-next/target-sqlite/control`.
      Without it, `contract emit` / build fails at runtime with "createNamespace is not a function".

    summary: |
      `SqlNamespace` is now an abstract class and the family placeholder concretion is gone. Rename the
      factory-input type `SqlNamespaceTablesInput` -> `SqlNamespaceInput` (it is the `createNamespace`
      factory input, not a tables-only type). The removed symbols `buildSqlNamespace`,
      `buildSqlNamespaceMap`, `SqlBoundNamespace`, and `SqlUnboundNamespace` have no drop-in replacement:
      construct SQL namespaces only through a target `createNamespace` factory (`postgresCreateNamespace`
      / `sqliteCreateNamespace`). Any hand-written SQL namespace type literal or fixture must carry the
      target `kind` (e.g. `'postgres-schema'`) instead of the removed `'sql-namespace'` discriminator.

    summary: |
      A field/column restricted to a value set (e.g. an enum) now derives its narrowed TS literal
      union **through the codec**, not the framework's (now-deleted) domain-enum override. If your
      extension authors a custom codec descriptor (`extends CodecDescriptorImpl`) used by a
      restricted/enum column, implement `renderValueLiteral(value, side)` on it so the column narrows
      to its value union; without it the column widens to the codec's output type
      (`CodecTypes[id][side]`). If your extension builds a `CodecLookup` by hand and drives the
      framework emitter (`generateContractDts`), expose `renderValueLiteralFor` so the emit path can
      reach your descriptor's renderer. Framework-built lookups (via the CLI/build / control-stack)
      already supply it — no action there. (`side`: `output` = the read/SELECT type, `input` = the
      create/update type.)

    summary: |
      SQL `encodeJson` / `decodeJson` now use the exact scalar shape produced by the corresponding
      database inside JSON values. SQL include decoding calls `decodeJson`; ordinary column decoding
      continues to call `decode`. Update custom SQL codecs whose database JSON representation differs
      from their normal driver wire representation, then re-emit committed contracts and defaults.
      Built-in representation changes are: `pg/bytea@1` base64 -> `\\x`-prefixed hex,
      `pg/numeric@1` string -> JSON number, `pg/timestamp@1` UTC `Z` suffix -> no timezone suffix,
      `pg/timestamptz@1` UTC `Z` suffix -> `+00:00`, `sqlite/bigint@1` string -> JSON number,
      `pg/vector@1` JSON array -> Postgres vector text, and `pg/geometry@1` GeoJSON object -> HEXEWKB
      text. SQLite cannot represent BLOB values inside its native JSON values; such queries still fail
      at the database boundary rather than receiving a synthetic codec representation.

      `deriveJsonSchema` / `derivePolymorphicJsonSchema` (from `@prisma-next/mongo-contract-psl`) now
      source a value-set field's `$jsonSchema` `enum` keyword from a value-set map, not the domain
      enum. Their fourth argument changed from a domain-enum map
      (`Record<string, ContractEnum>`, read as `members.map(m => m.value)`) to a value-set map
      (`FieldValueSets` = `Record<string, { values: readonly JsonValue[] }>`, keyed by the field's
      `valueSet` `entityName`). If your extension calls either function directly, pass the storage
      value sets (`contract.storage.namespaces[<ns>].entries.valueSet`) instead of `domain.enum`; the
      values are identical for enums, so the rendered validator is unchanged. Most extensions author
      Mongo contracts through `mongoContract(...)` / `defineContract(...)`, which call these

    summary: |
      `MigrationPlanner.plan()` (and the SQL family's `SqlMigrationPlannerPlanOptions`) drops the
      `keepDiffIssue` option — a caller-supplied `(issue: DiffIssue) => boolean` predicate the
      planner applied to its schema diff for multi-space ownership scoping. It is replaced by
      `ownership?: SchemaOwnership` — an ownership oracle (`{ declaresEntity(entityName): boolean }`,
      exported from `@prisma-next/framework-components/control`) that the `ContractSpaceAggregate`
      satisfies. The planner asks it, per live extra node, whether any contract space declares that
      entity: a node another space owns is left untouched, a node no space owns is a genuine extra it
      may drop under a destructive policy. If your extension calls `planner.plan(...)` directly with
      `keepDiffIssue` (rather than through the aggregate's `db init` / `db update` / `migrate`
      orchestration, which passes the aggregate as the oracle for you), drop the predicate and pass
      the aggregate (or any object implementing `SchemaOwnership`) as `ownership`. There is no
      names-set and no filter function — ownership lives in the aggregate; the planner only asks.

      They implemented the coordinate-based relational schema diff the migration planner used before
      it moved onto the generic node differ (`plan(start, end)`). There is no drop-in replacement —
      if your extension called either function directly to compare a contract against a live/derived
      schema, use the generic node differ instead: `diffSchemas` (from
      `@prisma-next/framework-components/control`) over two schema-IR trees, or a target's own
      `buildXPlanDiff` (e.g. `buildPostgresPlanDiff` from `@prisma-next/target-postgres/diff-database-schema`,
      `buildSqlitePlanDiff` from the sqlite target) for the same op-render-stamped comparison the

      `SqlControlTargetDescriptor` (from `@prisma-next/family-sql/control`) drops the
      `diffDatabaseSchema` field — the per-target `SchemaDiffer` hook that used to back the
      coordinate-based relational diff. If your extension implements a custom SQL target descriptor
      and supplied this field, remove it; the migration planner reaches the one differ directly via
      the target's own diff-tree builder now (see the `family-sql-collect-sql-schema-issues-removed`

      `ResolveRecordedPathInputs`. The function's behaviour, inputs, and outcome shape are

      imported it directly, use `buildPostgresPlanDiff` from
      `@prisma-next/target-postgres/diff-database-schema` instead — it runs the same one-differ
      comparison the planner itself uses (relational + RLS-policy issues in one node-typed list,

      `verifyType` hook, and `SchemaVerifier.issues` all report it. Its `outcome` field is also
      gone; use `reason` (`'not-found'` | `'not-expected'` | `'not-equal'`) instead — `outcome`'s
      `'missing'` / `'extra'` / `'mismatch'` map onto those three respectively. If your extension
      imports any of the removed types, constructs a `{ kind, table, message }`-shaped issue by

      `SchemaFindingLists` (and therefore `VerifyDatabaseSchemaResult.schema` /

      SchemaDiffIssue[]`) to one: `{ issues: SchemaDiffIssue[] }`. The framework `SchemaDiff`
      class follows the same collapse — its constructor now takes one issue array instead of
      two (`new SchemaDiff(issues)`, not `new SchemaDiff(issues, schemaDiffIssues)`), and
      `.filter()` narrows the single list. If your extension reads
      `result.schema.schemaDiffIssues` (or `.schema.warnings.schemaDiffIssues`) directly, or
      constructs a `SchemaDiff` by hand, update both call sites to the single-list shape —
      concatenate the old two lists into one, in the same order, if you need to reproduce prior

      type (e.g. a native enum) only ever diverges in its value set, so every paired
      `not-equal` finding grades as value drift (suppressed under an `external` control policy,
      same as before); `not-found` is a missing type, `not-expected` an extra one. If your

      pack can contribute declarative `@@` model attributes via
      `AuthoringContributions.modelAttributes` (an `AuthoringModelAttributeDescriptor` carries
      the bare attribute name, an ADR-231 `modelAttribute()` spec, and a lowering that files an
      entity into the namespace's `entries[attribute][key]`), and a PSL block descriptor can

      `native_enum` entities now serialize into an extension's emitted `contract.json` (previously they

      (`prisma-next contract emit`) and commit the result, so the `entries.native_enum` maps and the
      recomputed `storageHash` land in your checked-in `contract.{json,d.ts}`. Re-emitting is what makes
      your pack's enum type names visible in the published contract: a consumer running `contract infer`
      with your pack in the stack subtracts your pack-owned enum types by matching those serialized type
      names, so an un-re-emitted contract leaves the consumer re-declaring types your pack already owns.

      If your extension declares native Postgres enums, re-emit your bundled contract

      `nativeType` as the bare element type with `many: true` (previously it baked `"text[]"` into
      `nativeType`, so every list column verified `not-equal` against live introspection); (2) Postgres
      introspection now excludes expression-keyed indexes (e.g. on `lower(email)`) and no longer
      collides a unique and non-unique index over identical columns; (3) `contract infer` carries a
      non-default index access method through as `@@index(..., type: "<method>")` — note the type must
      be registered in the stack's IndexTypeRegistry to emit. Extensions that snapshot introspection
      output or assert on derived schema-IR for array/expression-indexed tables should re-run and
      refresh expectations.

      The postgres target gains a `pg/inet@1` codec (transparent string carrier, like `pg/uuid@1`):
      `inet` columns are now authorable as `String @db.Inet` in PSL and representable in contracts,
      and `contract infer` maps an introspected `inet` column to `String @db.Inet` instead of
      `Unsupported("inet")`. Purely additive — no existing contract changes; re-running `contract
      infer` against a database with inet columns now includes them in the output.

    summary: |
      PSL gains a standalone `role` block on the postgres target, authored inside the explicit
      unbound namespace: `namespace unbound { role anon {} }` (name-only, no parameters) lowers to a
      first-class `PostgresRole` entity in the contract's `__unbound__` storage slot
      (`control: 'external'` — roles are referenced, never owned; the planner emits no role DDL and
      `db verify` checks existence via `pg_roles`). The unbound namespace's purpose is late binding
      (search_path-resolved tables); roles are declared there because they are cluster-scoped and
      belong to no schema. To make this authorable, the "no `namespace unbound { }` alongside named
      namespaces" restriction is narrowed to models: a blocks-only unbound namespace is legal next
      to named namespaces, while one containing models next to named namespaces stays rejected
      (`PSL_RESERVED_NAMESPACE_NAME`). A `role` block anywhere else — a named namespace or the
      document top level — is rejected with `PSL_ROLE_BLOCK_OUTSIDE_UNBOUND_NAMESPACE`. Purely
      additive for existing contracts.

    summary: |
      The `@prisma-next/extension-supabase` shipped contract now declares Supabase's three standard
      Postgres roles (`anon`, `authenticated`, `service_role`) as first-class `role` entities with
      `control: 'external'`. `db verify` on a project composing the pack now fails with a `not-found`
      schema issue naming each declared role the live database lacks. Real Supabase databases always
      have these roles, so hosted projects need no change; a local or CI database that stands in for
      Supabase must create them — `bootstrapSupabaseShim` from
      `@prisma-next/extension-supabase/test/utils` already does. The public
      `SupabaseRoleBinding['role']` type is unchanged (`'anon' | 'authenticated' | 'service_role'`);
      it is now derived from the `SupabaseRole` Prisma Next enum handle's values; the contract declares the roles via the
      new PSL `role` blocks inside `namespace unbound { }` (see the `psl-role-block` entry).

TML-2787 (M:N slice 3): namespace-scoped execution-default refs land in
`@prisma-next/sql-orm-client` (nested writes through a junction, the
required-payload gate, and the namespace-keyed `ExecutionMutationDefault.ref`).
The changes are internal to the ORM client and its emitted-contract consumption;
the extension-author surface is unchanged. No extension-author action — re-emit
picks up the new contract ref shape. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2929 (replace legacy PSL parser with CST symbol table): the SQL/Mongo PSL
interpreters now consume a symbol table built from the CST parser instead of the
legacy `parsePslDocument` AST. The only `packages/3-extensions/` touch is a
test-file call-shape rewire in `postgres/test/psl-namespace-qualifier-routing.test.ts`
(`{ document }` → the symbol-table interpreter input); no extension-author API
changed. No extension-author action. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2794 (M:N slice 5): wires the `mn-psl` integration fixture into the
`@prisma-next/sql-orm-client` test `emit` script. Test-fixture infrastructure
only; no extension-author surface change. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2868 (Postgres RLS slice 1): adds the additive Postgres row-level-security
authoring feature. The only `packages/3-extensions/` touches are the re-emitted
`supabase/src/contract/contract.d.ts` (regeneration picks up the new RLS-capable
contract shape) and the `supabase/test/supabase-bootstrap.ts` test helper. No
extension-author API changed — the framework SPI is unchanged and re-emit
absorbs the contract shape. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2931 (entity-kind-migration-seam): implements the entity-kind seam for
schema diffing and provenance-symmetric RLS diff. The `packages/3-extensions/`
touches are test updates in `pgvector/test/migrations/` (planner fixtures
converted to `PostgresSchemaIR`) and `pgvector/test/descriptor.test.ts`
(contract shape updated to remove `__unbound__` namespace and adjust
`FieldOutputTypes`/`FieldInputTypes` to namespace-keyed form; precheck/postcheck
SQL assertions updated for parameterised queries). No extension-author API
changed. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2884 (Mongo enum end-to-end vertical): adds the Mongo domain-enum authoring
surface. The `packages/3-extensions/mongo/` touches are:
- New `mongo/src/contract/enum-type.ts` and exports in `mongo/src/exports/contract-builder.ts`
  (`enumType`, `member`, `EnumTypeHandle`, `EnumMember`) — all net-new exports; nothing
  existing was changed or removed.
- `mongo/src/runtime/mongo.ts` gains a `db.enums` facade property — an additive
  field on `MongoClient`; existing fields are unchanged.
- `mongo/package.json` gains `@prisma-next/emitter` and `@prisma-next/mongo-emitter`
  devDependencies for the new e2e test.
The `EnumTypeHandle` brand changed from a `Symbol()` to a string-key phantom (`__prismaNextEnumTypeHandle__`);
extension authors never construct or assert against the brand directly, so the structural surface
is unchanged. No extension-author action required — the enum surface is purely additive and
re-emit absorbs the new contract shape. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2886 (redo, PR #841): type SQL enum columns via a baked storage column lookup.
The SQL emitter generates a new `StorageColumnTypes` map in `contract.d.ts`, keyed
`[namespace][table][column]`; `FieldOutputTypes`/`FieldInputTypes` are derived from it
at emit time. The extension-package `contract.d.ts` fixtures (paradedb, pgvector,
postgis, supabase, sql-orm-client test fixture) regenerate to add the `StorageColumnTypes`
block. `contract.json` and hashes are byte-identical; `FieldOutputTypes` is unchanged.
No extension-author API or surface change. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2919: typed-DDL conversion of the not-null-with-temporary-default recipe (slice
1 of the typed-DDL migration-ops project). The recipe's ADD COLUMN execute step
now lowers a typed `PostgresAlterTable` DDL node through the adapter, with the
temporary backfill value carried as a `FunctionColumnDefault` — so the emitted
DEFAULT clause parenthesizes its expression (e.g. `DEFAULT ('')` instead of the
previous `DEFAULT ''`). Semantically identical in PostgreSQL. The recipe's DROP
DEFAULT step also routes through a new typed `DropDefaultAction`. The pgvector
`planner.behavior.test.ts` assertion that pins the recipe's emitted ADD COLUMN
SQL was updated to the parenthesized form. Test-only assertion update — no
extension-author API change. Incidental substrate diff only. (The 0.13 → 0.14
counterpart entry already records the same change; this entry covers the same
substrate diff against the post-0.14.0 main.)

TML-2911 (native scalar-array storage machinery): the emitted contracts now carry
the adapter-reported `scalarList` capability marker and the bumped envelope
version. The scalar-list machinery threaded through this release is internal — no
authoring path emits a list storage column yet, so extension contracts and runtime
behaviour are unchanged. No extension-author API or surface change. Incidental
substrate diff only.

PR #894 (postgres-rls slice 2, schema-node-tree-restructure): restructures the
schema-diff node tree, splits `db verify` into per-space contract-satisfaction

aggregate orchestration. The only `packages/3-extensions/` touches are test
files: `pgvector/test/migrations/planner.*.test.ts` (planner fixtures rebuilt
for the schema-node tree) and `supabase/test/classification.e2e.test.ts`
(comment wording). The renamed internals (`AggregateContractSpace`,

internals with no references in any extension source. No extension-author API

Exercise Mongo enums in retail-store (this PR): the `MongoClient` facade gains two

TML-2955 (expose the static ExecutionContext symmetrically): the built-in target
facades gain a client-safe `@prisma-next/{mongo,postgres,sqlite}/static` entrypoint
(`<target>Static`) and expose `db.context` / `db.contract`. Internally, the mongo
adapter codec now imports `ObjectId` from `bson` instead of `mongodb` so the static
`ExecutionContext` is genuinely driver-free (client-bundle-safe). All additive /
internal — no extension-author API or surface change; existing extensions are
unaffected. No extension-author action required. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2503 (extension-supabase slice D): `@prisma-next/extension-supabase` gains a
secondary `.supabase` admin root on `asServiceRole()` — new `ServiceRoleDb` /
`SupabaseInternalDb` exports from `/runtime`, backed by the extension contract's own
execution context plus a second runtime sharing the app pool + `service_role` session.
Purely additive for extension authors — no other extension's API is affected, and no
released surface changed (the `WithExtensionNamespaces` export existed only on this
branch's earlier, unmerged merge-design revision and was removed before merge). No
extension-author API change. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2892 (migration-author ContractView): the `unboundNamespace` helper that the
SQLite and Mongo runtimes use to unwrap their single default namespace was lifted
into the shared foundation (`@prisma-next/framework-components/ir`); the two
extension runtimes (`packages/3-extensions/{mongo,sqlite}/src/runtime`) now import
it from there instead of defining a local copy. Behaviour-preserving — the runtime
facade surface (`db.enums`, `sql`, `orm`) is byte-identical. No extension-author
API or surface change; nothing to migrate. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2915 (infer an enum's `@@type` from its members): a PSL `enum` block may now
omit `@@type` and have the codec inferred (text for bare/string members, int for
integers). Additive: the framework gains an optional `AuthoringEntityContext.enumInferenceCodecs`
and a `resolveEnumCodecId` export; each built-in target's config supplies its default
codec ids, and `@prisma-next/adapter-mongo` gains a `./codec-ids` entrypoint. Explicit
`@@type` is unchanged. No extension-author action required — the new context field is
optional and framework-populated. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2912 (PSL native scalar lists, end-to-end): PSL now lowers scalar-list fields
(`String[]`, `Int[]`, …) to native array storage columns instead of the JSONB
fallback, gated on the adapter-reported `scalarList` capability. The review-round
follow-up also makes the adapter capability matrix required end-to-end on the
contract-source seam — `ContractSourceContext.capabilities`,
`InterpretPslDocumentToSqlContractInput`, and the SQL PSL resolution inputs are no
longer optional. These are framework-internal contract-emission types that the
control stack always populates; extension authors do not construct them. The only
`packages/3-extensions/` touch is a one-line test-context update in
`postgres/test/psl-namespace-qualifier-routing.test.ts` (threading the now-required
`capabilities` field). No extension-author API changed — re-emit absorbs the

Postgres-RLS slice 2.5 (one-differ-two-ir-planner, the cutover to
`plan(start, end)`): the migration planner now diffs two derived schema IRs
via the generic node differ instead of the coordinate-based relational walk.
The only `packages/3-extensions/` touch is a fixture fix in
`pgvector/test/migrations/{planner.behavior,planner.contract-to-schema-ir}.test.ts`
— the hand-built `PostgresTableSchemaNode` foreign-key fixtures now stamp
`resolvedReferencedSchema` (the differ pairs FK nodes by id, which folds in
that field; an unresolved FK on a hand-built actual node no longer paired with
the derived expected side). Test-fixture-only; no extension-author API
changed. See the `sql-migration-planner-keep-diff-issue-to-ownership-oracle`,

`schema-issue-vocabulary-retired`, `schema-finding-lists-single-list`, and
`codec-verify-type-hook-returns-schema-diff-issue` entries above for the real
breaking changes this slice makes to the framework SPI.

TML-2976 (native Postgres enums, external Supabase types — this PR): the
`packages/3-extensions/` diff is additive. `@prisma-next/extension-postgres` gains a
`db.nativeEnums` accessor (new `src/runtime/native-enums.ts`; `runtime/postgres.ts`,
`exports/runtime.ts`, and `static/postgres-static.ts` expose it) — a Postgres-only
sibling of `db.enums` for reading external native enum columns.
`@prisma-next/extension-supabase` gains the same accessor and regenerates its bundled
contract (`src/contract/contract.{prisma,json,d.ts}`) to carry the `auth.aal_level`
native enum. A new `sql-orm-client` type test
(`test/native-enum.field-output.test-d.ts`) pins native-enum field-output typing.
All additive — the existing extension-author SPI is unchanged, and re-emit absorbs the
contract shape. No extension-author action required. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2962 (extension-aware contract infer, PR #919): `contract infer` now omits DB
elements a stack extension pack's contract space already describes, and resolves an
app table's foreign key into pack-owned space to the qualified cross-space relation
(`<spaceId>:<namespace>.<Model>`, e.g. `supabase:auth.AuthUser`) rather than a bare
local reference. The only `packages/3-extensions/` touch is the `supabase` package
gaining an `infer-cross-space-fk.integration.test.ts` and a `@prisma-next/psl-printer`
devDependency for it — no extension-author API changed. One new behavior worth noting
for pack authors: a pack that declares a table's storage coordinate but no domain
model mapped to it now makes `contract infer` throw (malformed pack); packs normally
ship storage + domain together, so no action for well-formed packs. No extension-author
action required. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2965 (native-enum-ts-authoring): a native Postgres enum + `pg.enum` column is now
authorable in the TypeScript DSL, producing a contract byte-identical to the PSL
`native_enum` equivalent (including in a non-`public` schema). The `packages/3-extensions/`
diff is additive: `@prisma-next/extension-postgres` gains `src/contract/native-enum.ts` —
`nativeEnum(name, ...values)` returns a handle whose entity name is `name` and whose
Postgres type name defaults to `name`; chain `.map(typeName)` to override the Postgres
type name only. A column binds the handle through `field.column(pg.enum(handle))` (the
deferred column descriptor resolved at contract-build time). The module exports
`nativeEnum` / `pg` / `NativeEnumHandle` from `src/exports/contract-builder.ts`;
`package.json` gains
`@prisma-next/emitter` and `@prisma-next/sql-contract-emitter` devDependencies for the
new test's `.d.ts` emission assertion. All net-new exports — nothing existing was
changed or removed. No extension-author action required. Incidental substrate diff only.

<!--
TML-2960 (no-emit native-enum column typing): a `field.column(pg.enum(handle))`
column now types as its member-value literal union in `typeof contract` (the
no-emit path), matching what the emit path already produced. The
`packages/3-extensions/` diff is the feature itself plus its type test:
`postgres/src/contract/native-enum.ts` makes `pg.enum()` generic over the
handle's members (returning a descriptor whose `entityRef.entity` is
`PostgresNativeEnum<Members>`), and
`postgres/test/contract-builder/native-enum-typeof.test-d.ts` pins the
resulting `typeof contract` types. Runtime values and emitted
`contract.{json,d.ts}` are byte-identical. The extension-author-facing type
reshape this rides on (`ScalarFieldState`'s first generic) is recorded in the
`scalar-field-state-descriptor-generic` entry above; beyond that, no
extension-author action. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2828 (variant relations on the narrowed accessor, PR #933): the
`packages/3-extensions/` diff is confined to `@prisma-next/sql-orm-client` (itself an
extension). The `.variant('X')`-narrowed predicate accessor now surfaces relations the
variant model declares in the contract, alongside the base model's relations —
`createModelAccessor` resolves a variant-owned relation against the variant's
coordinates (variant table for MTI, base table for STI), and
`VariantAwareModelAccessor` intersects in the variant's relation accessors so
`t.variant('Feature').where(x => x.assignee.some(…))` type-checks and plans a correct
EXISTS. Purely additive to the ORM client's query surface; no extension-author SPI
(`@prisma-next/contract`, `@prisma-next/framework-components`, …) changed. No
extension-author action required. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2883 (rls-ts-authoring): Postgres RLS is now authorable in the TypeScript DSL,
producing contracts wire-name-identical to the PSL `policy_*` / `@@rls` equivalents.
The `packages/3-extensions/` diff is additive: `@prisma-next/postgres` gains
`src/contract/rls.ts` (frozen branded handles from `policySelect` / `policyInsert` /
`policyUpdate` / `policyDelete` / `policyAll` / `rlsEnabled(model)` / `role(name)`;
predicates are opaque strings); its `defineContract` accepts an optional
`entities?: readonly RlsEntityHandle[]` input. The lowering is target-side: the
generic contract build groups `entities` handles by the pack that registered each
`entityKind` and calls the pack's batch hook (`lowerEntityHandles`, a SQL-family
contributions extension exported from
`@prisma-next/sql-contract/entity-handle-lowering-hook`), which target-postgres
implements beside its PSL lowering. A TS-declared `role(name)` lands in
`entries.role` under the `__unbound__` namespace, identical to a PSL `role` block
(roles are cluster-scoped). `@prisma-next/extension-supabase` gains `anon` /
`authenticated` role-handle exports from `/contract`. Supporting additive exports
only elsewhere: `buildContractDefinition` from
`@prisma-next/sql-contract-ts/contract-builder`; `formatRlsPolicyWireName` +
`POLICY_OPERATION_PREDICATES` from `@prisma-next/target-postgres/rls-canonicalize`.
`entities` is the sole public channel for attaching pack entities; the internal
`packEntities` input never had a real author and was removed (test-only, never
documented as user-facing), so no extension-author action is required. Incidental
substrate diff only.

pg binding resolution by structure, not instanceof (PR #969): the
`packages/3-extensions/` diff is a bug fix plus additive exports. The postgres
extension (`@prisma-next/postgres`) gains two net-new `/runtime` exports —
`isPgPool` / `isPgClient`, structural type guards that identify a `pg`
Pool/Client by shape instead of `instanceof`. `resolvePostgresBinding` and the
`@prisma-next/extension-supabase` `toPool` helper now use them, so a
caller-supplied pool that came from a duplicated `pg` copy in an app bundle
resolves correctly instead of throwing `Unable to determine pg binding type`
at boot. The change only accepts inputs the old `instanceof` check rejected —
nothing that resolved before resolves differently — and the two guards are
additive. No extension-author action required. Incidental substrate diff only.
