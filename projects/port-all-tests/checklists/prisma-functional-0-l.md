# Checklist — prisma/prisma client functional (suites 0–l)

Source: prisma/prisma@a6d01554528e016bea1467a072776b0e2b94dcba — packages/client/tests/functional/

Protocol: each line is one source test. `[ ]` = not yet dispositioned. The Opus reviewer sub-agent checks `[x]` ONLY when satisfied that the test is (a) faithfully ported and passing, (b) faithfully ported as `test.fails` with a `failing.md` entry, or (c) covered by a justified individual `non-ported.md` entry. Implementer sub-agents never check boxes.
