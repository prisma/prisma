# Checklist — prisma-engines query-engine tests (queries/)

Source: prisma/prisma-engines@e922089b7d7502aff4249d5da3420f6fa55fc6ad — query-engine/connector-test-kit-rs/query-engine-tests/tests/queries/

Protocol: each line is one source test. `[ ]` = not yet dispositioned. The Opus reviewer sub-agent checks `[x]` ONLY when satisfied that the test is (a) faithfully ported and passing, (b) faithfully ported as `test.fails` with a `failing.md` entry, or (c) covered by a justified individual `non-ported.md` entry. Implementer sub-agents never check boxes.
