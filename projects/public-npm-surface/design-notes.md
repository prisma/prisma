# Public npm surface — design notes

The system-level design is settled and recorded in [ADR 242](../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20242%20-%20Public%20npm%20surface%20-%20single%20%40prisma%20scope%20with%20consolidated%20publish%20packages.md); these notes hold only execution-level decisions made while shaping this project.

## Principles

- **Additive until the switchover.** Old package names and imports work at every intermediate commit; the publish list and `private` flags flip in one PR.
- **Shells re-export, never copy.** One module, one published package — the ADR's identity rule is the invariant every slice must preserve.
- **The registry is the deliverable.** Verification runs against packed tarballs, not workspace links, because workspace resolution hides exactly the class of bug (phantom deps, missing exports entries) this project exists to eliminate.

## Execution decisions

- **Internal workspace names stay `@prisma-next/*`.** Private names never reach npm; renaming ~50 packages and every in-repo import buys nothing the `private` flag doesn't provide. Recorded as a spec non-goal; flagged to operator (spec OQ 3).
- **Facades are relocated entry packages, not new code.** Today's per-database entry packages already do the wiring; they move to `packages/9-public/` and gain re-export entrypoints rather than being rewritten.
- **Shim keeps its current name for now** (spec OQ 2); the `prisma` succession is out of scope per ADR 242's deferred decisions.

## Open questions

Tracked in `spec.md § Open questions` — org readiness, shim interim name, internal-name confirmation, `middleware-cache` naming depth.
