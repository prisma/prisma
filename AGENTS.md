# Prisma Repository – Agent Field Notes

> **Meta note**: This is the primary agent knowledge base file. `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are symlinks to this file—always edit `AGENTS.md` directly. When learning something new about the codebase that would help with future tasks, update this file immediately.

- **Repository scope**: Monorepo for Prisma ORM, CLI, client, tests, etc. Many packages use TypeScript, Rust and WebAssembly (via engines), TSX, and Jest; automation relies on `pnpm`. Expect large fixture directories and generated files.
- **Workspace layout**: Managed via pnpm workspaces and Turborepo (`turbo.json`). Node ^20.19 || ^22.12 || >=24.0 and pnpm >=11 <12 are required (see root `package.json`). Top-level scripts (`pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`) delegate into `scripts/ci/publish.ts`; package-specific commands run with `pnpm --filter @prisma/<pkg> <script>`. Turborepo caches builds; run `pnpm build` from root to build all packages in dependency order.
  - **pnpm 11 configuration lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.** pnpm 11 no longer reads the `pnpm` field of `package.json` (so `overrides` moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) nor pnpm-specific settings from `.npmrc` (`.npmrc` is auth/registry only; `shellEmulator`, `autoInstallPeers`, `savePrefix` moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in camelCase). `peerDependencyRules` already lived there.
  - **Build-script approval uses `allowBuilds`, not `onlyBuiltDependencies`.** pnpm 11 removed `onlyBuiltDependencies`/`neverBuiltDependencies` and replaced them with `allowBuilds` (a map of package matcher → `true`/`false`) in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. pnpm 11 still _reads_ a stray `onlyBuiltDependencies` key (so `pnpm config get` echoes it) but no longer _acts_ on it, so leftover entries silently do nothing. With `strictDepBuilds` defaulting to `true`, any dependency with an unreviewed build script fails `pnpm install` in CI with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` (exit 1) — a warning-only situation under pnpm 10. Current allow-list: `@swc/core`, `better-sqlite3`, `esbuild`, `sharp`, `sqlite3`, `workerd`, `yarn`. Verify completeness with `pnpm approve-builds` (should report "no packages awaiting approval"); `pnpm approve-builds --all` appends approvals to `allowBuilds`.
  - **pnpm 11 does not link a workspace package's bin when its target is missing at install time.** A workspace dependency whose `bin` points at a build output (e.g. `prisma` → `build/index.js`) is not built yet during `pnpm install`, so pnpm 11 skips creating its `node_modules/.bin` entry and — unlike pnpm 10, which created a dangling symlink — never backfills it on later `pnpm install`/`--force`/`rebuild` (only a clean `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install` after the target exists relinks it). Scripts that rely on the bin (`pnpm prisma …`, `pnpm exec prisma …`) then fail with `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL] Command "prisma" not found`. Invoke the CLI through the resolved built entry instead (see `packages/bundle-size/create-gzip-files.ts`, which runs `node <pkg>/node_modules/prisma/build/index.js`).
  - **CI decouples the pnpm runtime from the test Node.js.** pnpm 11 requires Node.js >=22.13, but the test matrix still exercises Node.js 20. `pnpm/action-setup` is configured with `standalone: true` (installs `@pnpm/exe`, which bundles its own Node.js), so pnpm runs on its bundled Node.js while `pnpm run <script>` executes under the matrix Node.js resolved from PATH (verified: scripts use the PATH `node`, not pnpm's bundled one). Keep `standalone: true` on every `action-setup` step. The e2e Docker container (`packages/client/tests/e2e/_utils/standard.dockerfile`) deliberately stays on pnpm 10.x because its standalone projects rely on per-test `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json`.
- **Key packages**: `packages/cli` (Prisma CLI entry point), `packages/migrate` (migrate/db namespace + fixtures), `packages/client` (client runtime), `packages/client-generator-ts` (new `prisma-client` generator), `packages/client-generator-js` (traditional `prisma-client-js` generator), `packages/client-generator-registry` (generator registry for managing generators), `packages/client-engine-runtime` (the core part of the new Rust binary free client based on Wasm query compiler, used by `ClientEngine` class in `packages/client`), `packages/client-common` (shared client utilities), `packages/client-runtime-utils` (utility types and singletons for Prisma Client), `packages/config` (`PrismaConfigInternal` + loader), `packages/internals` (shared CLI + engine glue), `packages/engines` (Rust binaries download wrapper), `packages/integration-tests` (matrix suites), `packages/query-plan-executor` (standalone query plan executor service for Prisma Accelerate), `packages/credentials-store` (credential storage utilities), sqlcommenter packages under `packages/sqlcommenter*`, and numerous driver adapters under `packages/adapter-*`.
- **Driver adapters & runtimes**: `packages/bundled-js-drivers` plus the `adapter-*` packages ship JS driver adapters: `adapter-pg`, `adapter-neon`, `adapter-libsql`, `adapter-planetscale`, `adapter-d1`, `adapter-better-sqlite3`, `adapter-mssql`, `adapter-mariadb`, `adapter-ppg` (Prisma Postgres Serverless). These are built on helpers in `driver-adapter-utils`; migrate/client fixtures exercise them, so adapter changes typically require fixture/test updates. CI tests driver adapters with flavors: `js_pg`, `js_neon`, `js_libsql`, `js_planetscale`, `js_d1`, `js_better_sqlite3`, `js_mssql`, `js_mariadb`, `js_pg_cockroachdb`.
- **Build & tooling**: Typescript-first repo with WASM/Rust assets (downloaded by `@prisma/engines`). Multiple `tsconfig.*` drive bundle vs runtime builds. Lint via `pnpm lint`, format via `pnpm format`. Maintenance scripts live in `scripts/` (e.g. `bump-engines.ts`, `bench.ts`, `ci/publish.ts` orchestrates build/test/publish flows). Build configuration uses esbuild via `helpers/compile/build.ts` with configs in `helpers/compile/configs.ts`. Most packages use `bundledConfig` which bundles to both CJS and ESM with type declarations.
- **Benchmarking**: Comprehensive performance benchmarks using Benchmark.js with CodSpeed integration. See `docs/benchmarking.md` for full documentation. Key commands:
  - `pnpm bench` - Run all benchmarks (outputs to `output.txt`)
  - `pnpm bench <pattern>` - Run benchmarks matching pattern
  - Benchmark locations:
    - End-to-end query performance: `packages/client/src/__tests__/benchmarks/query-performance/query-performance.bench.ts`
    - Query compilation: `packages/client/src/__tests__/benchmarks/query-performance/compilation.bench.ts`
    - Query interpreter/data mapper: `packages/client-engine-runtime/bench/interpreter.bench.ts`
    - Client generation: `packages/client/src/__tests__/benchmarks/huge-schema/`, `packages/client/src/__tests__/benchmarks/lots-of-relations/`
  - Benchmarks run automatically on CI via `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`; CodSpeed tracks performance over time and alerts on >100% regression.
- **Testing & databases**: `TESTING.md` covers Jest/Vitest usage. Most suites run as `pnpm --filter @prisma/<pkg> test <pattern>`. DB-backed tests expect `.db.env` and Docker services from `docker/docker-compose.yml` (`docker compose up -d`). Client functional tests sit in `packages/client/tests/functional`—run them via `pnpm --filter @prisma/client test:functional` (with typechecking) or `pnpm --filter @prisma/client test:functional:code` (code only); `packages/client/helpers/functional-test/run-tests.ts` documents CLI flags to target providers, drivers, etc. Client e2e suites require a fresh `pnpm build` at repo root, then `pnpm --filter @prisma/client test:e2e --verbose --runInBand`. The legacy `pnpm --filter @prisma/client test` command primarily runs the older Jest unit tests plus `tsd` type checks. Migrate CLI suites live in `packages/migrate/src/__tests__`, the CLI runs both Jest (legacy suites) and Vitest (new subcommand coverage) via `pnpm --filter prisma test`, and end-to-end coverage lives in `packages/integration-tests`.

- **Client functional tests structure**:
  - Each test lives in its own folder under `packages/client/tests/functional/` (or `issues/` for regression tests).
  - Required files: `_matrix.ts` (test configurations), `test.ts` or `tests.ts` (test code), `prisma/_schema.ts` (schema template).
  - `_matrix.ts` defines provider/adapter combinations using `defineMatrix(() => [[{provider: Providers.POSTGRESQL}, ...]])`.
  - `prisma/_schema.ts` exports `testMatrix.setupSchema(({ provider }) => ...)` returning a Prisma schema string.
  - Test file uses `testMatrix.setupTestSuite(() => { test(...) }, { optOut: { from: [...], reason: '...' } })`.
  - Run specific adapter: `pnpm --filter @prisma/client test:functional:code --adapter js_pg <pattern>` (adapters: `js_pg`, `js_neon`, `js_libsql`, `js_planetscale`, `js_d1`, `js_better_sqlite3`, `js_mssql`, `js_mariadb`, `js_pg_cockroachdb`). Options come before the pattern, with no `--` separator. The adapter implies the provider, so `--provider` is rarely needed; pass `--provider` together with `--remote-executor` to exercise the Accelerate code path. Flags are documented in `packages/client/helpers/functional-test/run-tests.ts`.
  - For error assertions, use `result.name === 'PrismaClientKnownRequestError'` and `result.code` (not `instanceof`).
  - Use `idForProvider(provider)` from `_utils/idForProvider` for portable ID field definitions.

- **Docs & references**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` contains dependency graphs (requires GraphViz to regenerate), `docker/README.md` explains local DB setup, `docs/benchmarking.md` covers performance benchmarking, `examples/` provides sample apps, and `sandbox/` hosts debugging helpers like the DMMF explorer. Planning documents live under `docs/plans/<topic>/` as a numbered index (`000-<topic>-index.md`) plus per-task files.

- **Client architecture (Prisma 7)**:
  - `ClientEngine` in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/engines/client/` orchestrates query execution using Wasm query compiler.
  - Two executor implementations: `LocalExecutor` (driver adapters, direct DB) and `RemoteExecutor` (Accelerate/Data Proxy).
  - `QueryInterpreter` class in `packages/client-engine-runtime/src/interpreter/query-interpreter.ts` executes query plans against `SqlQueryable` (driver adapter interface).
  - Query plans are cached and shared between requests (`QueryPlanCache` in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/engines/client/query-plan-cache.ts`), so the interpreter receives them as `DeepReadonly` and must never mutate them (#29262 fixed such a bug and added a functional regression test in `packages/client/tests/functional/issues/29254-query-plan-cache-mutation`). Code that needs a modified plan must copy the affected nodes; structural sharing of unaffected subtrees is fine (see `purifyQueryPlan`).
  - Query flow: `PrismaClient` → `ClientEngine.request()` → query compiler → `executor.execute()` → `QueryInterpreter.run()` → driver adapter.
  - `ExecutePlanParams` interface in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/engines/client/Executor.ts` defines what's passed through the execution chain.
  - `TransactionManager` in `packages/client-engine-runtime/src/transaction-manager/transaction-manager.ts` owns interactive transaction IDs and implements nested transactions using savepoints. Savepoint SQL is provider-specific (e.g. PostgreSQL uses `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT <name>`, MySQL/SQLite use `ROLLBACK TO <name>`, SQL Server uses `SAVE TRANSACTION <name>` / `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION <name>` and has no release statement).
  - `Transaction` in `packages/driver-adapter-utils` models savepoint behavior as async methods (`createSavepoint`, `rollbackToSavepoint`, optional `releaseSavepoint`) instead of returning SQL via `savepoint(action, name)`. `TransactionManager` expects adapter methods for savepoints and does not synthesize provider fallback SQL.
  - Fluent API `dataPath` is built in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/model/applyFluent.ts` by appending `['select', <relationName>]` on each hop; runtime unpacking in `packages/client/src/runtime/RequestHandler.ts` currently strips `'select'`/`'include'` segments before `deepGet`.
  - In extension context resolution, `dataPath` should be interpreted as selector/field pairs (`select|include`, relation field). Do not strip by raw string value or relation fields literally named `select`/`include` get dropped.

- **Adding PrismaClient constructor options**:
  - Runtime types: `PrismaClientOptions`, `PrismaClientBaseOptions`, `PrismaClientOptionsWithAdapter`, `PrismaClientOptionsWithAccelerateUrl` in `packages/client/src/runtime/getPrismaClient.ts`. `PrismaClientOptions` is a discriminated union (`PrismaClientOptionsWithAccelerateUrl | PrismaClientOptionsWithAdapter`) where each branch is `PrismaClientBaseOptions & { ... discriminator }`. Avoid going back to the older `(A | B) & C` shape: TypeScript reports errors against the named branches with the new layout (`not assignable to type 'PrismaClientOptionsWithAccelerateUrl'`) instead of expanding anonymous types like `{ accelerateUrl: string; adapter?: never; } & PrismaClientBaseOptions`.
  - Validation: `packages/client/src/runtime/utils/validatePrismaClientOptions.ts` (add to `knownProperties` array and `validators` object).
  - Engine config: `EngineConfig` interface in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/engines/common/Engine.ts`.
  - Generated types: Update both `packages/client-generator-js/src/TSClient/PrismaClient.ts` (`buildClientOptions` method) and `packages/client-generator-ts/src/TSClient/file-generators/PrismaNamespaceFile.ts` (`buildClientOptions` function). The TS generator mirrors the runtime layout, emitting four exported types (`PrismaClientBaseOptions`, `PrismaClientOptionsWithAdapter`, `PrismaClientOptionsWithAccelerateUrl`, `PrismaClientOptions`); the JS generator keeps a single flat `PrismaClientOptions` interface for legacy compatibility.
  - Use `@prisma/ts-builders` for generating TypeScript type declarations.
  - Current known options: `errorFormat`, `adapter`, `accelerateUrl`, `log`, `transactionOptions`, `omit`, `comments`, `__internal`.
  - The generated constructor parameter type is `Prisma.PrismaClientConstructorArgs<Options>` (defined in `packages/client-generator-js/src/TSClient/common.ts` for the JS generator, and emitted by `packages/client-generator-ts/src/TSClient/file-generators/PrismaNamespaceFile.ts` for the TS generator). It resolves to a plain `PrismaClientOptions` when `Options` defaults to `PrismaClientOptions` (the case when the user passes nothing or `{}`), and falls back to `Subset<Options, PrismaClientOptions>` otherwise. This keeps the "missing adapter" TypeScript error readable (`not assignable to parameter of type 'PrismaClientOptions'` instead of `Subset<...>`) while still rejecting unknown properties at the type level for the literal-argument case.
  - **Union order matters.** `PrismaClientOptions` lists `PrismaClientOptionsWithAccelerateUrl` first and `PrismaClientOptionsWithAdapter` second. When `// @ts-nocheck` is present on the file that declares the union (and the generated `prismaNamespace.ts` _does_ keep `@ts-nocheck` for type-check performance), TypeScript's missing-property error elaboration for a discriminated union reports against the **second** union member. Putting the adapter branch second makes `new PrismaClient({ log: [...] })` say `Property 'adapter' is missing in type ... but required in type 'PrismaClientOptionsWithAdapter'` (the recommended option for most users) instead of suggesting `accelerateUrl`. Keep the same order in both the runtime types (`getPrismaClient.ts`) and the generator (`PrismaNamespaceFile.ts`).
  - JSDoc on individual constructor option properties shows up via **autocomplete** (TypeScript's `getCompletionEntryDetails`) but not via **hover** on an already-written property name when the parameter type is generic. This is a TypeScript limitation that also affects query args like `where` / `select` / `take` (see microsoft/TypeScript#32542). Do not try to "fix" it by removing the generic parameter from the constructor signature — doing so breaks log/omit type inference.
  - The "missing driver adapter" runtime error is raised from both `validatePrismaClientOptions` (constructor-level, primary user-facing message) and `ClientEngine` (defense-in-depth). When updating the wording, also update the inline snapshot in `packages/client/src/__tests__/validatePrismaClientOptions.test.ts`.

- **Creating new packages**:
  - Create directory under `packages/`, add `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.build.json`, and `helpers/build.ts`.
  - Package is auto-discovered via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` glob `packages/*`.
  - For type-only packages, use `bundledConfig` from `helpers/compile/configs.ts`.
  - Add as dependency to consuming packages using `"workspace:*"` version.
  - **Important**: Add resolution path to `tsconfig.build.bundle.json` under `compilerOptions.paths` for go-to-definition to work in editors.
  - **Important**: If the package has tests, add it to `.github/workflows/test-template.yml`. Utility packages typically go in:
    - `others` job (Linux, no Docker): includes `debug`, `generator-helper`, `get-platform`, `fetch-engine`, `engines`, `instrumentation`, `instrumentation-contract`, `schema-files-loader`, `config`, `dmmf`, `generator`, `credentials-store`, `sqlcommenter-*` packages.
    - `client-packages` job: includes `client-common`, `client-engine-runtime`, `ts-builders`, `client-generator-js`, `client-generator-ts`, `client-generator-registry`.
    - `driver-adapter-unit-tests` job: includes `adapter-libsql`, `adapter-mariadb`, `adapter-d1`, `adapter-pg`, `adapter-planetscale`, `adapter-mssql`, `adapter-neon`.
    - `no-docker` job (Windows/macOS): mirrors the `others` and `client-packages` jobs for cross-platform testing.

- **Prisma 7 direction**: Migration from `schema.prisma` datasource URLs / `env()` to `prisma.config.ts`. Commands, tests, and fixtures should read connection settings from `PrismaConfigInternal.datasource` (or driver adapters) rather than CLI flags or environment loading. SQLite datasource URLs now resolve relative to the config file and not to the schema.
- **Test helpers**: `ctx.setConfigFile('<name>')` (from `__helpers__/prismaConfig.ts`) overrides the config used for the next CLI invocation and is automatically reset after each test, so no explicit cleanup is needed. Many migrate fixtures now provide one config per schema variant (e.g. `invalid-url.config.ts` next to `prisma/invalid-url.prisma`) and tests swap them via `ctx.setConfigFile(...)`. `ctx.setDatasource`/`ctx.resetDatasource` continue to override connection URLs when needed.

- **CLI commands**: Most commands already accept `--config` for custom config paths. Upcoming work removes `--schema` / `--url` in favour of config-based resolution. When editing CLI help text, keep examples aligned with new config-first workflow.
  - For isolated Studio verification, you can run `packages/cli/src/Studio.ts` directly via `pnpm exec tsx` and pass a config object that preserves `loadedFromFile`; this keeps SQLite URLs resolving relative to the config file while avoiding unrelated `packages/cli/src/bin.ts` imports.
  - Studio is now pre-bundled into `packages/cli/build/studio.js` and `packages/cli/build/studio.css`, served only through explicit routes in `packages/cli/src/Studio.ts` via the runtime-specific `packages/cli/src/studio-server.ts` bindings, and should keep listener-level coverage in `packages/cli/src/__tests__/studio-server.vitest.ts` because a past Node regression dropped `GET` bodies by treating them like `HEAD`.
  - If Enter or click does not open a cell editor in Studio, verify that the current table and column are writable before assuming a keyboard regression; views/system tables and read-only columns legitimately stay non-editable.

- **Driver adapters datasource**:
  - Helper `ctx.setDatasource()` in tests overrides config.datasource for connection-specific scenarios.

- **Testing patterns**:
  - Tests rely on fixtures under `packages/**/src/__tests__/fixtures`; many now contain `prisma.config.ts`.
  - Default Jest/Vitest runner is invoked via `pnpm --filter @prisma/<pkg> test <pattern>`; it wraps `dotenv` and expects `.db.env`.
    - Some packages already use Vitest, `packages/cli` uses both for different tests as it's in the process of transition, older packages still use Jest.
  - Functional generated clients in `packages/client/tests/functional/**/.generated` import `packages/client/runtime/client.js` directly; runtime changes in `src/runtime` may need corresponding runtime bundle updates to be exercised by functional tests.
  - Client e2e `_steps.ts` files run inside `packages/client/tests/e2e/_utils/standard.dockerfile`; the startup script exports `NODE_PATH` for CommonJS and symlinks globally installed `zx` into `/test/node_modules` because ESM package resolution ignores `NODE_PATH`. Linux Docker runs may need SELinux-compatible bind mounts (`:z`) for mounted e2e files to be readable in the container.
  - Each client e2e test is copied to `/test/<name>` in the container and `pnpm install`ed there as a standalone root (the e2e dir's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`/`.npmrc` are not copied along), so a per-test `pnpm.overrides` in the test's `package.json` takes effect. Use it to pin transitive deps that float via `^` ranges and can break tests out of the blue — e.g. the `prisma-client-imports-*` suites typecheck with `skipLibCheck: false` against pinned `@types/node@20` / TS 5.4, and a new `pg-protocol` release using generic `Buffer<T>` types broke the postgres suite that way. Note: `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` works in pnpm 10 (what the container pins) but is ignored by pnpm 11.
  - Inline snapshots can be sensitive to formatting; prefer concise expectations unless the exact message matters.

- **Environment loading**: Prisma 7 removes automatic `.env` loading.

- **Driver adapter error handling**:
  - Database errors are mapped in each adapter's `errors.ts` (e.g., `packages/adapter-pg/src/errors.ts`).
  - `MappedError` type in `packages/driver-adapter-utils/src/types.ts` defines all known error kinds.
  - Known error kinds include: `GenericJs`, `UnsupportedNativeDataType`, `InvalidIsolationLevel`, `LengthMismatch`, `UniqueConstraintViolation`, `NullConstraintViolation`, `ForeignKeyConstraintViolation`, `DatabaseNotReachable`, `DatabaseDoesNotExist`, `DatabaseAlreadyExists`, `DatabaseAccessDenied`, `ConnectionClosed`, `TlsConnectionError`, `AuthenticationFailed`, `TransactionWriteConflict`, `TableDoesNotExist`, `ColumnNotFound`, `TooManyConnections`, `ValueOutOfRange`, `InvalidInputValue`, `MissingFullTextSearchIndex`, `SocketTimeout`, `InconsistentColumnData`, `TransactionAlreadyClosed`, and database-specific kinds (`postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mssql`).
  - `convertDriverError()` in each adapter maps database-specific error codes to `MappedError` kinds.
  - `rethrowAsUserFacing()` in `packages/client-engine-runtime/src/user-facing-error.ts` maps `MappedError` kinds to Prisma error codes (P2xxx).
  - To add a new error mapping: (1) add kind to `MappedError` in driver-adapter-utils, (2) map database error code in relevant adapter(s), (3) add Prisma code mapping in `getErrorCode()` and message in `renderErrorMessage()`.
  - Raw queries (`$executeRaw`, `$queryRaw`) use `rethrowAsUserFacingRawError()` which always returns P2010; regular Prisma operations use `rethrowAsUserFacing()`.
  - When no specific mapping exists for a database-specific kind (`postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mssql`) — i.e. the adapter didn't recognize the underlying DB error code — `rethrowAsUserFacing()` falls back to a P2039 `UserFacingError` with the message `Database error. Code: <originalCode>. Message: <originalMessage>` carrying the raw `originalCode` / `originalMessage`. This keeps the DB error surface as `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` locally and as an HTTP 400 from the query plan executor (instead of HTTP 500, which Accelerate strips), so that schema-drift-style failures (stale migrations, stale generated client, etc.) remain debuggable. Raw queries keep the historical P2010 (`Raw query failed. Code: <originalCode>. Message: <originalMessage>`) via `rethrowAsUserFacingRawError()`; P2039 is used for non-raw queries so the message doesn't claim a regular Prisma operation was a raw query. Truly unknown `kind` values still fall through to `assertNever` so new driver-adapter variants surface clearly during development.
  - Prisma error codes currently assigned outside the documented public Error Reference (P2000–P2037) are: **P2038** — used for the `PrismaClientInitializationError` raised by `ClientEngine` when no driver adapter is configured (see `CLIENT_ENGINE_ERROR` in `packages/client/src/runtime/core/engines/client/ClientEngine.ts`); **P2039** — used for unmapped database-specific driver-adapter errors as described above. Pick the next available code (P2040, …) for any new additions and document it here.

- **SQL Commenter packages**:
  - `@prisma/sqlcommenter`: Core types (`SqlCommenterPlugin`, `SqlCommenterContext`, `SqlCommenterQueryInfo`, `SqlCommenterTags`) for building sqlcommenter plugins.
  - `@prisma/sqlcommenter-query-tags`: AsyncLocalStorage-based plugin for adding ad-hoc tags via `withQueryTags()` and `withMergedQueryTags()`.
  - `@prisma/sqlcommenter-trace-context`: Plugin for adding W3C Trace Context `traceparent` header to queries.
  - `@prisma/sqlcommenter-query-insights`: Plugin for adding parameterized query shapes to comments (format: `Model.action:base64Payload`).
  - Plugins are registered via `PrismaClient({ comments: [plugin1(), plugin2()] })`.
  - E2E tests for sqlcommenter plugins live in `packages/client/tests/e2e/sqlcommenter*` directories.
  - `SqlCommenterQueryInfo` distinguishes `type: 'single'` (single query) vs `type: 'compacted'` (batched queries merged into one SQL statement). For non-raw client-engine queries, the SQL commenter context should receive parameterized query payloads so plugins such as query-insights never see user data values.

- **AI agent safety checkpoint**: `packages/migrate/src/utils/ai-safety.ts` blocks `db drop`, `db push --force-reset`, `db push --accept-data-loss`, and `migrate reset` when an AI agent is detected, unless `PRISMA_USER_CONSENT_FOR_DANGEROUS_AI_ACTION` is set. Do not replace the in-house detection with `@vercel/detect-agent` (rationale in the comment above `agentMatchers`). Its tests must clear inherited agent marker env vars in `beforeEach`, since the test process may itself run under an agent. The `prisma mcp` server (`packages/cli/src/mcp/MCP.ts`) deliberately exposes no `migrate-reset` tool — an agent that needs a reset must run the CLI, where the checkpoint applies. Do not add destructive tools to the MCP server.

- **Codebase helpers to know**:
  - `@prisma/internals` exports CLI utilities: `arg`, `loadSchemaContext` (less used now).
  - `packages/migrate/src/__tests__/__helpers__/context.ts` sets up Jest helpers including config contributors.
  - `packages/config` defines `PrismaConfigInternal`; inspect when validating config assumptions.
  - `@prisma/ts-builders` provides a fluent API for generating TypeScript code (interfaces, types, properties with doc comments).
  - `@prisma/driver-adapter-utils` defines core interfaces: `SqlQuery`, `SqlQueryable`, `SqlDriverAdapter`, `SqlDriverAdapterFactory`, `SqlMigrationAwareDriverAdapterFactory`, `MappedError` for error handling, `ConnectionInfo`, `Provider` type (`'mysql' | 'postgres' | 'sqlite' | 'sqlserver'`).
  - `@prisma/client-engine-runtime` exports query interpreter, transaction manager, and related utilities.
  - `@prisma/client-common` provides shared client utilities used by both generators and runtime.
  - `@prisma/client-runtime-utils` provides utility types and singletons for Prisma Client.
  - NPS survey infrastructure lives in `packages/cli/src/utils/nps/` (`survey.ts` orchestrates: TTY check via `isInteractive` from `@prisma/internals`, 30s prompt timeout, gating on `isCi`/`maybeInGitHook`/`isInNpmLifecycleHook`/`isInContainer`, once-per-timeframe persistence in `env-paths('prisma').config` as `nps.json`). Triggered only from `prisma generate` (suppressed by `--no-hints` and watch mode). Reuse this machinery for any new one-time interactive CLI prompt.
  - `prisma mcp` (`packages/cli/src/mcp/MCP.ts`) is a stdio MCP server exposing `migrate-status`, `migrate-dev`, `migrate-reset`, and `Prisma-Studio` tools by shelling back into the CLI binary.

- **Coding conventions**:
  - Use **kebab-case** for new file names (e.g., `query-utils.ts`, `filter-operators.test.ts`).
  - **Avoid creating barrel files** (`index.ts` that re-export from other modules). Import directly from the source file (e.g., `import { foo } from './utils/query-utils'` not `import { foo } from './utils'`), unless `./utils/index.ts` file already exists (in which case use it for consistency with surrounding code).
  - **Avoid adding useless code comments that do not add new information for the reader**.
    Inline code comments can be broadly categorized as answering one of the three questions:
    - _What does this code do?_ — never write these because they do not and cannot convey any new information that's not obvious from the code. Not only they don't add value, they are actively harmful (getting out of sync with code, distracting human readers, wasting LLM tokens etc). Descriptions of units of code like functions, classes and methods must be limited to doc comments (and describe the contract of this unit and not the internal implementation details), never inline comments.
    - _Why was this code written (in this particular way or at all)?_ — this is what inline comments are for. Only use them to include relevant context, background, GitHub issues, reasons behind decisions etc.
    - _How does this code work?_ — these comments should be exceedingly rare and may indicate poorly written or confusing code. Prefer writing code in a way that makes such comments redundant, unless required for performance or other reasons, or when the complexity comes from outside systems or packages (in which case it's more of a "why" comment than a "how" comment anyway). For well known algorithms, prefer their names and references to papers, books or Wikipedia articles over long explanations.
  - Do write documentation comments, and mainly do so for exported items (although intra-module documentation may sometimes be useful as well).
  - The correct and official abbreviation of WebAssembly is "Wasm", not "WASM". There are instances of "WASM" in the codebase, but they are wrong and you should not repeat them. Fix the capitalization whenever you incidentally touch the corresponding lines or surrounding code for other reasons.
  - Prefer native JavaScript private properties and methods (`#field`) over the `private` keyword in TypeScript.

- **Workflow reminders**:
  - Respect existing structure: modifications often require updating both command implementation and tests/fixtures.
  - Keep changes ASCII unless a file already uses Unicode (docs sometimes include emojis).
  - For new fixtures, prefer minimal config mirroring existing ones to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
  - When adding features that span multiple packages, build from root (`pnpm build`) to ensure correct dependency order.
  - Type-only imports from workspace packages work at runtime but IDE may show errors until `pnpm install` refreshes the workspace graph.
  - Test files named `*.test.ts` are excluded from build output via esbuild config; place tests alongside source files.
  - **Update this file** (`AGENTS.md`) whenever you learn something new about the codebase that would be valuable for future tasks.

- **Knowledge reminders**:
  - Your training data contains a lot of outdated information that doesn't apply to Prisma 7. Always analyze this codebase like you would analyze a project you are not familiar with, and prefer the learnings from this file and this codebase over your prior knowledge. In particular, remember:
    - **There's no such thing as "query engine" in Prisma**
    - **There are no database URLs in Prisma schema files**
    - **Prisma uses JavaScript drivers**
    - **Query execution code is written in TypeScript in Prisma**
    - PSL parser and query compiler/planner is still written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. There are no native binaries or library addons in Prisma Client.
    - Schema engine for Prisma Migrate still exists and is still a native binary. Its `--datasource <JSON>` CLI argument (serialized `Datasource` from `PrismaConfigInternal`) is _required_ since engines PR #5683 — spawning the binary without it fails at startup with a structopt error, surfaced as `Error in Schema engine`. When no datasource is configured (e.g. schema-only `migrate diff`), `SchemaEngineCLI` passes `--datasource {}`; both fields of the engine-side `DatasourceUrls` struct are optional, so `{}` is always accepted.

## Debugging and making changes to Rust/WebAssembly code

When you need to check the code or make some changes in Rust codebase, assume the repository is checked out in the `prisma-engines` directory above the root of this repo. Determine the absolute path to the current project on the filesystem (e.g. `/home/user/work/prisma`) and infer the directory of the `prisma-engines` repo (e.g. `/home/user/work/prisma-engines`, let's call it `$PRISMA_ENGINES_ROOT`).

After you make some changes there, use these commands in the prisma-engines repo to build the Wasm modules:

```sh
make build-schema-wasm
make build-qc-wasm
```

Then, back in `prisma` repo:

```sh
pnpm upgrade -r @prisma/prisma-schema-wasm@file:$PRISMA_ENGINES_ROOT/target/prisma-schema-wasm
pnpm upgrade -r @prisma/query-compiler-wasm@file:$PRISMA_ENGINES_ROOT/query-compiler/query-compiler-wasm/pkg
pnpm build
```

You may only need to build and update one of these modules if your changes are isolated in scope:

1. Build only `prisma-schema-wasm` if your changes are isolated to schema and DMMF, and you are only going to run the CLI and generator tests, not Client.
2. Build only `query-compiler-wasm` if your changes are related to query planning and execution but do not touch the schema or DMMF in any way.

When in doubt, build both to avoid unexpected behavior. Time and cost of compilation is always less than of debugging.
