# Prisma Migrate

This directory contains the documentation for the Prisma Migrate, Prisma 2's schema migration tool. To learn more about the respective CLI commands, check out the docs for the [Prisma 2 CLI](../prisma2-cli.md).

> ⚠️ Prisma Migrate is currently in an **experimental** state. When using any of the prisma2 migrate commands, you need to explicitly opt-in to that functionality via an `--experimental` flag, e.g. `prisma2 migrate save --experimental`.
