# ADR 213 — Codec lifecycle hooks

## Status

Accepted (TML-2397). Companion mechanism to [ADR 212 — Contract spaces](./ADR%20212%20-%20Contract%20spaces.md).

## At a glance

Some schema-driven extension behaviour is *not* a function of the extension version but of the consuming application's schema. Cipherstash is the canonical example: when a user adds an `Encrypted<String>` column with `searchable: true`, the database needs `INSERT INTO eql_v2_configuration (...) VALUES (...)` (registering the column for search). That work is per-`(table, column)`, not per-cipherstash-version, and ADR 212's contract-space mechanism on its own can't express it — cipherstash's contract space is a pure function of the cipherstash *package*, not of the consuming app's schema.

Codecs already exist as first-class objects: every column in the contract names its codec via `codecId`. This ADR promotes codecs to also carry a **plan-time lifecycle hook**, fired on field-added / field-dropped / field-altered events, that emits app-space migration ops scoped to the columns where the codec applies.

## Context

[ADR 212](./ADR%20212%20-%20Contract%20spaces.md) gives extensions a uniform planner / runner / verifier surface for schema they ship as a pure function of their package version. That covers most of cipherstash's footprint — the EQL bundle, the `eql_v2_configuration` table, the typed objects `Encrypted<String>` columns reference. But it doesn't cover the per-column work: registering each searchable column with EQL via `INSERT INTO eql_v2_configuration (...)` (or a similarly per-column DDL/DML for other future codecs).

Two failed approaches surfaced before settling on codec hooks:

1. **Encode per-column behaviour in the application's contract.** Would force the user to author cipherstash-specific structural ops in their own migrations; couples app authoring to extension internals.
2. **Have cipherstash watch the user's contract diff.** No clean seam — cipherstash has no privileged read on the user's emit pipeline, and a per-extension API for reading app diffs is exactly the surface this ADR avoids.

The right seam is the codec itself. Every column in the contract already names its codec; the planner already runs per-field diff during emit; codecs already export hooks for runtime behaviour (`expandNativeType`, `resolveIdentityValue`). Adding an `onFieldEvent` hook is structurally cheap and keeps "what to do when this column changes" co-located with "what this column means at runtime."

## Decision

Codecs may declare an optional **plan-time** `onFieldEvent` hook. The framework's app-space planner invokes the hook for every per-field event on a column whose `codecId` references that codec; returned ops are inlined into the resulting app-space migration's `ops.json`.

### Hook contract

```ts
// packages/2-sql/9-family/src/core/migrations/types.ts
export type FieldEvent = 'added' | 'dropped' | 'altered';

export interface FieldEventContext {
  readonly tableName: string;
  readonly fieldName: string;
  readonly priorTable?: StorageTable;     // present for 'dropped' and 'altered'
  readonly newTable?: StorageTable;       // present for 'added' and 'altered'
  readonly priorField?: StorageColumn;    // present for 'dropped' and 'altered'
  readonly newField?: StorageColumn;      // present for 'added' and 'altered'
}

export interface CodecControlHooks<TTargetDetails = unknown> {
  // … existing hooks (expandNativeType, resolveIdentityValue, etc.) …
  readonly onFieldEvent?: (
    event: FieldEvent,
    ctx: FieldEventContext,
  ) => readonly SqlMigrationPlanOperation<TTargetDetails>[];
}
```

The hook is **synchronous** (no I/O at plan time), receives concrete SQL family IR (`StorageTable` / `StorageColumn` from `@internal/sql-contract/types`), and returns a list of migration ops each carrying its own `invariantId`.

### Triggered events and dispatch

The app-space emitter walks the per-field diff between the prior and new app contracts:

- **`'added'`** — field present in `newTable` but not `priorTable`. Hook is dispatched on the *new* field's codec.
- **`'dropped'`** — field present in `priorTable` but not `newTable`. Hook is dispatched on the *prior* field's codec.
- **`'altered'`** — field present in both, and any field property other than `codecId` differs. Hook is dispatched on the *new* field's codec.

When only `codecId` differs between the prior and new fields, no `'altered'` event fires. Codec-id changes are a v1 non-goal: cleanly extending the event vocabulary with a `'codec-changed'` event is straightforward when a real consumer needs it.

### Returned ops are app-space-bound

Codec-emitted ops are inlined into the **consuming application's** migration JSON (app space), alongside the user's own structural ops. The hook signature has no parameter for cross-space context — by API shape it cannot return ops targeting another space.

This is a deliberate scoping choice: opening cross-space hooks raises ordering questions (which extension-space does an app-side codec event author into? what if a hook depends on another extension's ops?), backward-compat questions (can a codec hook *change* an extension's pinned migration history?), and ownership questions (is a codec a member of one space?). None had concrete consumers when this ADR was written; the hook was kept narrow until they do.

The data invariant *"search-config registered for `User.email`"* is conceptually about application content. Cipherstash's contract space stays a pure function of the cipherstash package version; consuming-app activity never reaches into it.

Note: cross-space *SQL writes* are still possible inside an op's body (e.g. `INSERT INTO eql_v2_configuration ...` writes into a cipherstash-owned table — the database integrates regardless), but the migration *op record* is app-space.

### Each op carries an `invariantId`

Hook-returned ops are typed `SqlMigrationPlanOperation<TTargetDetails>[]`. Each op must carry an `invariantId` of the codec's choice. The `invariantId` ends up in the marker's `applied_invariants` set after apply, which makes the hook participate in [ADR 208](./ADR%20208%20-%20Invariant-aware%20migration%20routing.md)'s ref-driven routing.

By convention, codec-emitted invariantIds carry a `<extension>-codec:` prefix and identify the column being acted on:

```text
cipherstash-codec:User.email:add-search-config@v1
cipherstash-codec:User.email:remove-search-config@v1
```

The convention keeps codec-emitted invariantIds visually distinct from extension-space invariantIds (`cipherstash:install-eql-bundle-v1`).

### Wiring

Two pieces of plumbing connect the hook to the planner:

- **`extractCodecControlHooks(descriptors)`** (in `@internal/family-sql/control`) — collects `onFieldEvent` hooks across all loaded extension descriptors into a `Map<codecId, CodecControlHooks>`. Erases target-details to `unknown` at the codec-extraction boundary (pre-existing convention shared with the rest of `extractCodecControlHooks`'s return type).
- **`planFieldEventOperations(options)`** (in `@internal/family-sql/control`) — given the prior/new app contracts and the hook map, walks per-field diffs, dispatches hooks, and returns the concatenated `SqlMigrationPlanOperation<unknown>[]` ready to inline into the app-space migration. Each target's planner casts the helper's `unknown` results back to its target-details specialisation at the integration site (scoped per-line `.map(...)` cast with an explanatory comment, per the codebase's typesafety rules).

The cast-at-integration-site pattern mirrors the existing `extractCodecControlHooks` shape and the rest of the SQL family's codec-control surface: `extractCodecControlHooks` already erases target-details to `unknown` because codec hooks are inherently cross-target (one codec implementation works for both Postgres and SQLite). Either we widen the type at the consumer site (current pattern) or every hook is generic over its target — the latter inflates type complexity for marginal benefit.

This is a deliberate departure from the original intention to keep the surface generic over `TTargetDetails` end-to-end. It is structural-not-cosmetic — the helper boundary at `unknown` is what makes target-agnostic codec packages possible — and is called out here so future readers don't try to "tighten" the type without understanding why it's loose.

### Op order

Within a single migration, structural ops come first, then codec-emitted ops grouped by triggering event (added → dropped → altered). Within a group, ordering is deterministic by `(tableName, fieldName)` then by hook-returned op index. This ordering is contract — a codec author can rely on the structural `CREATE COLUMN` running before their hook-emitted `INSERT INTO eql_v2_configuration`.

### When the ops appear on disk

The hook fires inside the planner. The planner runs in two distinct flows, and the hook participates in both — but with very different observable behaviour:

| Flow                          | Hook fires? | What happens to the returned ops                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prisma-next migrate`         | yes         | Inlined into the app-space migration's `ops.json` and rendered into the user's `migrations/<timestamp>/migration.ts` alongside their `addColumn` / `dropColumn` calls. The user reviews them in the same PR. |
| `prisma-next db init`         | yes         | Applied immediately against the live database; never written to disk. (Greenfield synthesis: the planner runs from `∅` to the current contract every time.)                                  |
| `prisma-next db update`       | yes         | Applied immediately against the live database; never written to disk. (Reconciliation synthesis from the live schema.)                                                                       |
| `prisma-next db apply`        | no          | The ops in `migration.ts` are already pinned; apply replays them.                                                       |

This mirrors the broader `migrate` (persist) vs `db init`/`db update` (apply-and-forget) asymmetry that holds for *all* planner output, not just codec hooks. Codec-emitted ops are not special — they flow through the same `TypeScriptRenderablePostgresMigration` (and SQLite mirror) pipeline as structural ops, and are indistinguishable from user-authored ops in `migration.ts`. A reviewer reading a PR cannot tell from the file alone which calls came from a codec hook and which were emitted by a structural diff — by design.

### Worked example: cipherstash

```ts
const cipherstashStringCodecHooks: CodecControlHooks = {
  expandNativeType: ({ nativeType }) => nativeType,

  onFieldEvent: (event, { tableName, fieldName, newField, priorField }) => {
    const searchable = newField?.typeParams?.['searchable'] === true;
    const wasSearchable = priorField?.typeParams?.['searchable'] === true;

    if (event === 'added' && searchable) {
      return [{
        id: `cipherstash-codec.${tableName}.${fieldName}.add-search-config`,
        operationClass: 'data',
        invariantId: `cipherstash-codec:${tableName}.${fieldName}:add-search-config@v1`,
        execute: [{
          description: `register ${tableName}.${fieldName} as searchable`,
          sql: `INSERT INTO eql_v2_configuration (table_name, column_name, ...) VALUES ($1, $2, ...)`,
          params: [tableName, fieldName],
        }],
      }];
    }

    if (event === 'dropped' && wasSearchable) {
      return [{
        id: `cipherstash-codec.${tableName}.${fieldName}.remove-search-config`,
        operationClass: 'data',
        invariantId: `cipherstash-codec:${tableName}.${fieldName}:remove-search-config@v1`,
        execute: [{
          description: `unregister ${tableName}.${fieldName}`,
          sql: `DELETE FROM eql_v2_configuration WHERE table_name = $1 AND column_name = $2`,
          params: [tableName, fieldName],
        }],
      }];
    }

    return [];
  },
};
```

The hook reads `typeParams.searchable` off the field, decides whether work is needed, and emits ops. It never reads the live database, never reads cipherstash's contract-space contract or marker — those advance independently via ADR 212's per-space mechanism. It is a pure function over IR.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Schema-driven extension behaviour has a clean seam.** Cipherstash's `cipherstash:string@1` codec emits per-column work without coupling the application to cipherstash internals. Future schema-driven codecs (e.g. mask-on-read, audit columns, soft-delete tracking) follow the same pattern.
- **Codec-emitted ops are first-class.** Each op carries an `invariantId` that participates in `findPathWithDecision` routing (ADR 208), shows up in the marker's `applied_invariants` set, and is verifiable by the same machinery that verifies user-authored ops.
- **The pin captures the snapshot.** The codec implementation that runs is the one *active at plan time*; the resulting JSON pins that snapshot of the codec's behaviour. Apply-time replay just runs the captured ops — apply is decoupled from the codec module.

### Trade-offs

- **Hooks are synchronous-by-design.** They can't read DB state at plan time; if a codec needs DB-state-aware planning, it must take a different approach (probably an extension-owned migration of its own under ADR 212, or a deferred mechanism not yet designed).
- **App-space-bound by API shape.** Cross-space codec hooks are out of scope; if a real consumer surfaces the need, the API can grow a new context shape rather than retrofitting cross-space behaviour into `onFieldEvent`.
- **Helper boundary types `unknown`.** `planFieldEventOperations` returns `SqlMigrationPlanOperation<unknown>[]`; the integration site casts back to its target-details specialisation. Documented as a structural divergence from the spec's first-cut generic vision; aligns with the existing `extractCodecControlHooks` surface.
