# ADR 246 — Option arguments and select templates for authoring helpers

## At a glance

Field presets take enumerated arguments, spelled as bare tokens in PSL and string literals in TypeScript, declared with an `option` argument kind and dispatched to fragments of the preset's output by `select` template nodes. Two omission rules complete the design: an argument the author does not supply leaves no trace in the contract.

The temporal presets are the motivating example. An author writes:

```prisma
model Page {
  updatedAt temporal.timestamp(3, onCreate: now, onUpdate: now)
  lastSeen  temporal.timestamp(3)
  touched   temporal.timestamptz(onUpdate: now)
}
```

`updatedAt` is a `timestamp(3)` column whose value the runtime writes on insert and on update — execution defaults ([ADR 158](ADR%20158%20-%20Execution%20mutation%20defaults.md)), applied by the data layer at mutation time, not DDL defaults or triggers. `lastSeen` is the same column type with no behavior. `touched` is written on update only. The TypeScript surface spells the same three fields positionally:

```ts
updatedAt: field.temporal.timestamp(3, 'now', 'now'),
lastSeen:  field.temporal.timestamp(3),
touched:   field.temporal.timestamptz(undefined, undefined, 'now'),
```

A field preset ([ADR 170](ADR%20170%20-%20Pack-provided%20type%20constructors%20and%20field%20presets.md)) is declared as data, and an enumerated argument is one line of that data:

```ts
const TEMPORAL_ON_UPDATE_ARG = {
  name: 'onUpdate',
  kind: 'option',
  values: ['now'],
  optional: true,
} as const;
```

The preset itself is a template over its arguments:

```ts
export function temporalCodecPresetWithPrecision<
  const CodecId extends string,
  const NativeType extends string,
>(input: { readonly codecId: CodecId; readonly nativeType: NativeType }) {
  return {
    kind: 'fieldPreset',
    args: [TEMPORAL_PRECISION_ARG, TEMPORAL_ON_CREATE_ARG, TEMPORAL_ON_UPDATE_ARG],
    output: {
      codecId: input.codecId,
      nativeType: input.nativeType,
      typeParams: { precision: { kind: 'arg', index: 0 } },
      executionDefaults: {
        onCreate: temporalPhaseTemplate(1),
        onUpdate: temporalPhaseTemplate(2),
      },
    },
  } as const satisfies AuthoringFieldPresetDescriptor;
}
```

Four decisions make that work:

1. **`option` argument kind** — an argument whose value must be one of an enumerated list, spelled as a bare token in PSL and typed as a literal union in TypeScript. The type is shared with the extension-block parameter vocabulary: one option concept, declared once.
2. **The `select` template node** — a declarative token-to-template dispatch, validated against the option's `values` at pack registration, so preset vocabulary (`now`) never leaks the internal identifier it selects (`timestampNow`).
3. **Undefined phase omits the phase** — an execution-defaults phase whose template resolves to `undefined` is left out, and a phases object with no keys is left out entirely.
4. **Empty resolved `typeParams` is omitted** — a `typeParams` template that resolves to `{}` produces no `typeParams` key at all.

## The `option` argument kind

The option concept is one shared type, declared once in [option-descriptor.ts](../../../packages/1-framework/1-core/framework-components/src/shared/option-descriptor.ts):

```ts
export interface AuthoringOption {
  readonly kind: 'option';
  readonly values: readonly string[];
}
```

Both declarative surfaces reference it: `AuthoringArgumentDescriptor` ([framework-authoring.ts](../../../packages/1-framework/1-core/framework-components/src/shared/framework-authoring.ts)) includes it as a member of its union, and `PslBlockParamOption` ([psl-extension-block.ts](../../../packages/1-framework/1-core/framework-components/src/shared/psl-extension-block.ts)) extends it with the block-parameter presence flag. One type for one idea — a helper argument and a block parameter that both mean "one of these tokens" cannot drift apart, because there is nothing to drift.

**PSL spells an option as a bare token** (`onUpdate: now`), following `@relation(onDelete: Cascade)` — the established spelling for an enumerated attribute argument. Bare identifiers are ordinary argument expressions in the PSL grammar, so the parser's only job is to accept the identifier text ([psl-authoring-arguments.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-psl/src/psl-authoring-arguments.ts)):

```ts
case 'option': {
  const trimmed = rawValue.trim();
  return /^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/.test(trimmed) ? trimmed : INVALID_AUTHORING_ARGUMENT;
}
```

That case checks **syntax only**; membership in `values` is validated by the framework layer, which owns the error message. A quoted `onCreate: "now"` is rejected — one spelling, not two — and reports through the existing `PSL_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_ARGUMENT` plumbing. The option kind introduces no diagnostic code of its own.

**TypeScript spells an option as a string literal** (`'now'`). `ArgTypeFromDescriptor` ([authoring-type-utils.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/authoring-type-utils.ts)) resolves an option descriptor to the literal union of its `values`, so the legal set is autocompleted and enforced by the compiler.

## `select`: preset vocabulary is not generator vocabulary

Templates have two non-literal nodes. An **argument reference** inserts an argument's value:

```ts
export type AuthoringArgRef = {
  readonly kind: 'arg';
  readonly index: number;
  readonly path?: readonly string[];
  readonly default?: AuthoringTemplateValue;
};
```

A **select node** inserts a template *chosen by* an argument's value:

```ts
export interface AuthoringSelectRef {
  readonly kind: 'select';
  readonly index: number;
  readonly path?: readonly string[];
  readonly cases: Readonly<Record<string, AuthoringTemplateValue>>;
}
```

Substitution and selection are different operations, so they are different node kinds — a reader seeing `kind: 'arg'` knows the argument's value lands in the output verbatim; seeing `kind: 'select'` knows it does not. The temporal presets use a select to turn the token `now` into a generator descriptor:

```ts
function temporalPhaseTemplate<const Index extends number>(index: Index) {
  return {
    kind: 'select',
    index,
    cases: { now: { kind: 'generator', id: TIMESTAMP_NOW_GENERATOR_ID } },
  } as const;
}
```

The point is the indirection. `timestampNow` is a preset-only generator id ([ADR 169](ADR%20169%20-%20Declared%20applicability%20for%20mutation%20default%20generators.md)) and must not appear in a user's spelling. `select` keeps the user-facing token and the internal id as separate vocabularies related by data, rather than passing the token through as an id and coupling the two forever.

Resolution: read `args[index]`, walk `path`; an `undefined` value resolves to `undefined` (the enclosing object template then omits the key — this is what makes an unsupplied phase argument leave no trace); a defined value must be a string that is an own key of `cases`, and the node resolves to that case's recursively resolved template. Anything else throws — an assertion for type-bypassing callers, because:

**Case coverage is validated at pack registration.** Every select node must target an `option` argument, and the option's `values` must exactly cover the node's `cases` — a legal token with no case and a case no token can reach are both declaration bugs, and both are caught when the pack is composed (the check runs from `assertNoCrossRegistryCollisions`, so the PSL control stack and the TypeScript composed helpers inherit it from the same seam). The enumeration is declared in the option and *checked* against the cases; the two cannot silently disagree.

**Constraint:** a select node must not be used in the `codecId`, `nullable`, `id`, or `unique` positions of a preset output. Those feed the TypeScript builder-state inference through `ResolveTemplateValue`, which does not implement select. The temporal presets use select only inside `executionDefaults`, which builder-state inference never reads.

## Which check protects which surface

The two surfaces are validated by different mechanisms, and deliberately do not share an error message.

| Surface | What rejects a bad option value | Message |
|---|---|---|
| PSL | `validateAuthoringArgument`, at authoring time | `Authoring helper argument at <path> must be one of: now` |
| TypeScript | the literal union, at compile time | a type error |
| TypeScript, type bypassed | the select node's throw | `Authoring template select has no case for value "<value>"` |

The asymmetry follows from a standing architectural property: **the TypeScript authoring surface performs no runtime argument validation.** `buildFieldPreset` ([contract-dsl.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/contract-dsl.ts)) calls `instantiateAuthoringFieldPreset` directly and never calls `validateAuthoringHelperArguments`; that validator exists for the PSL path, which has to coerce untyped source text. On the TypeScript surface the type system *is* the check. Where a caller bypasses the type — a `string` variable, an untyped JavaScript caller — the select node's throw is the only backstop, and it reads as an internal invariant rather than user-facing guidance, which is appropriate for a case the types already exclude.

A future author adding an argument kind should know which check they are relying on, because the answer differs by surface.

## Two omission rules

Both exist so that an argument the author did not supply leaves **no trace** in the contract.

**A phase that resolves to `undefined` is omitted.** `resolveExecutionMutationDefaultPhase` treats an `undefined` resolution as "this phase is not declared"; `resolveAuthoringExecutionDefaultsTemplate` returns `undefined` when the resulting phases object has no keys. A contract never carries `executionDefaults: {}`. A phase that resolves to something defined but not a generator descriptor is a malformed descriptor, and throws.

**An empty resolved `typeParams` is omitted.** After resolving, an object with zero keys is treated as `undefined`:

```ts
const normalizedTypeParams =
  typeParams !== undefined && Object.keys(typeParams).length === 0 ? undefined : typeParams;
```

Object-template resolution drops `undefined` values, so `temporal.timestamp()`'s template `{ precision: { kind: 'arg', index: 0 } }` resolves to `{}` when no precision is supplied. Absent and `{}` are equivalent to every consumer that reads them, but they are not equal to a byte comparison — and a contract that carried `{}` would differ from the bare `Timestamp` type constructor that produces the same column.

### The two rules carry each other

These are not independent conveniences. `temporal.updatedAt()` is byte-identical to `temporal.timestamptz(onCreate: now, onUpdate: now)` **only because** empty-`typeParams` normalization exists: `timestamptz` declares a `{ precision: arg0 }` template that `updatedAt` does not declare at all, and with no precision supplied that template must resolve to `{}` and then vanish for the two outputs to match. Change either rule and the shorthand guarantee breaks.

## One preset per codec, named for the codec

The rule that makes the namespace work: **a per-codec preset's name is its codec's base name.** `pg/timestamp@1` → `temporal.timestamp`, `pg/timestamptz@1` → `temporal.timestamptz`, `sqlite/datetime@1` → `temporal.datetime`.

That is what lets the per-codec presets share the `temporal` namespace with the behavioral convenience presets without collision, and it is why a target registers them by spreading:

```ts
temporal: {
  .../* @__PURE__ */ temporalAuthoringPresets({
    codecId: 'pg/timestamptz@1',
    nativeType: 'timestamptz',
  }),
  timestamp: /* @__PURE__ */ temporalCodecPresetWithPrecision({
    codecId: 'pg/timestamp@1',
    nativeType: 'timestamp',
  }),
  timestamptz: /* @__PURE__ */ temporalCodecPresetWithPrecision({
    codecId: 'pg/timestamptz@1',
    nativeType: 'timestamptz',
  }),
},
```

Arguments change **properties of the field** — its precision, its execution-default behavior — never its codec. A target that adds a temporal codec adds a preset named after it; it does not add an argument to an existing preset that switches codec.

Two factories exist because the codecs differ in whether they take parameters: `temporalCodecPresetWithPrecision` for `pg/timestamp@1` and `pg/timestamptz@1`, whose descriptors declare a precision params schema, and `temporalCodecPreset` for `sqlite/datetime@1`, whose descriptor declares void params. Both preserve literal types end-to-end (`const` type parameters, `as const satisfies`); without that the codec id widens to `string` and the option's `'now'` widens with it, silently costing the TypeScript surface both its inference and its enforcement.

### The convenience presets are held equal by tests

`temporal.createdAt()` and `temporal.updatedAt()` are the behavioral spellings. `createdAt` is a **storage** default (`now()` rendered into DDL) — a different mechanism from execution defaults, and deliberately not expressible through `onCreate: now`. `updatedAt` is shorthand for `temporal.timestamptz(onCreate: now, onUpdate: now)`.

That shorthand relationship is **a claim about two separately authored descriptors that share no code.** `temporalAuthoringPresets` and `temporalCodecPresetWithPrecision` ([timestamp-now-generator.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/9-family/src/core/timestamp-now-generator.ts)) construct their outputs independently; nothing structural forces them to agree. They are held equal by tests, and by nothing else:

- `it('updatedAt() is byte-identical to timestamptz(onCreate: now, onUpdate: now)')` in [interpreter.defaults.test.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-psl/test/interpreter.defaults.test.ts)
- `describe('temporal.updatedAt() three-way byte-identity')` in [ts-psl-parity.test.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-psl/test/ts-psl-parity.test.ts), covering PSL-full ≡ PSL-convenience ≡ TS-full

An editor changing either factory must keep those green, or the shorthand silently stops being a shorthand.

### What the parity tests do and do not prove

All four spellings — PSL and TypeScript, convenience and full — funnel through the same `instantiateAuthoringFieldPreset`. So the parity assertions prove **the spellings agree with each other**. They cannot prove the output is correct: a resolver bug moves all four together and every parity test stays green.

Correctness is proved by the **absolute** assertions in `describe('temporal per-codec preset lowering')` in [interpreter.defaults.test.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-psl/test/interpreter.defaults.test.ts), which pin whole column shapes and whole execution-defaults lists against literals. The two kinds of test are not substitutes.

## Optional arguments on the TypeScript surface

`TupleFromArgumentDescriptors` gives an `optional: true` descriptor an optional tuple slot, which is what makes `field.temporal.timestamp()` and `field.temporal.timestamp(3)` legal calls. Two constraints follow. Required arguments must precede optional ones in a descriptor's `args` list: TypeScript rejects an optional tuple element followed by a required one, and `validateAuthoringHelperArguments`'s minimum-arity computation treats an optional-before-required argument as effectively required anyway. And a middle optional argument is skipped with an explicit `undefined` hole (`field.temporal.timestamptz(undefined, undefined, 'now')`), which the runtime accepts for any optional argument.

### A preset that declares `id`/`unique` needs an overload pair

Because the argument tuple can infer as empty, a single-signature helper with a trailing `options?: NamedConstraintSpec` would bind the first real argument to `options`. `FieldHelperFunctionWithNamedConstraint` is therefore an intersection of two call signatures — a no-options signature first, an options-required signature second — so `field.id.nanoid({ size: 16 })` and `field.id.nanoid({ size: 16 }, { name: 'x' })` both resolve correctly.

### Which check protects which argument object

An **all-optional** preset argument object is a weak type, and TypeScript's weak-type detection rejects an object sharing none of its properties — this is what rejects `field.nanoid({ bogus: 1 })` and what routes `field.id.nanoid({ name: 'x' })` to the named-constraint overload. `ObjectArgumentType` therefore emits the optional-only mapped type directly in that case, rather than intersecting with an empty-object constituent:

```ts
export type ObjectArgumentType<Properties extends Record<string, AuthoringArgumentDescriptor>> = [
  RequiredObjectArgumentKeys<Properties>,
] extends [never]
  ? {
      readonly [K in OptionalObjectArgumentKeys<Properties>]?: ArgTypeFromDescriptor<Properties[K]>;
    }
  : {
      readonly [K in RequiredObjectArgumentKeys<Properties>]: ArgTypeFromDescriptor<Properties[K]>;
    } & {
      readonly [K in OptionalObjectArgumentKeys<Properties>]?: ArgTypeFromDescriptor<Properties[K]>;
    };
```

`{}` is not itself a weak type, so an intersection with it silently disables the check.

An argument object with **required** properties is not weak, and relies on the ordinary excess-property check instead. Both are correct; they are different mechanisms, and an author adding a descriptor should know which one is protecting them — the more so because, on this surface, there is no runtime check behind either.

## What the presets rely on downstream

Three facts about the wider system make the presets safe without any adapter or runtime involvement:

- `{ precision }` typeParams on the postgres timestamp codecs flow through DDL rendering; the `Timestamp(3)` type-position constructor produces the same contract shape and exercises the same path.
- A parameterized codec with absent `typeParams` is probed with `{}` in [sql-context.ts](../../../packages/2-sql/5-runtime/src/sql-context.ts), and `undefined` is normalized to `{}` in resolve-codec — so omitting `typeParams` entirely is equivalent to every consumer that reads it.
- The `timestampNow` generator — control descriptor, runtime generator, adapter lowering — is target-agnostic and serves both the postgres and sqlite presets.

## Alternatives considered

**A boolean argument** (`onUpdate: true`). Cheaper, but it names the *presence* of a behavior rather than the behavior itself, leaving no room for a second generator value later without a breaking change. The `option`/`select` pair is open to `values: ['now', ...]` plus a case; none ships today.

**A quoted string argument** (`onUpdate: "now"`). Rejected to keep one spelling per concept. Bare tokens already carry enumerated values in PSL (`onDelete: Cascade`), and accepting both spellings would mean two ways to write the same thing forever.

**Passing the token through as the generator id.** Would delete `select` entirely — and would make `timestampNow` user-facing vocabulary, contradicting ADR 169's preset-only applicability and welding the authoring spelling to an internal identifier.

**A `map` property on the argument reference** (`{ kind: 'arg', index, map: { now: … } }`). Rejected because it overloads the reference's meaning — a node whose `kind` says "insert the argument's value" would, with `map` present, insert something else entirely — and because it leaves the token enumeration declared in two places (the option's `values` and the map's keys) with nothing coupling them before a runtime throw. The dedicated `select` node names the operation and makes the coupling a registration-time check.

**A variant-selecting argument** (`temporal.timestamp(withTimezone: true)`). Rejected: it makes an argument change the field's codec. Keeping "one preset per codec, arguments change field properties" means the codec is always readable from the spelling.

**Composing a type-position constructor with a behavioral preset.** The two mechanisms do not compose because a preset owns the whole column descriptor. Use a constructor such as `Timestamp(3)` when only storage shape is needed; use `temporal.timestamp(3, …)` when the field also needs preset behavior.

**Deriving the convenience presets structurally from the full form.** `temporal.updatedAt()` could be the full-form descriptor with its arguments pre-bound — one construction, equivalence by identity, no parity test needed. Rejected: partial argument binding is a new framework concept on descriptors, and it could only ever cover `updatedAt` — `createdAt` is a storage default, which the per-codec presets deliberately cannot express, so it stays separately authored regardless. Removing one preset's worth of drift risk did not justify the new seam; the equivalence is enforced by the named tests instead.

**Type-level `select` support in `ResolveTemplateValue`.** Not needed while select is confined to `executionDefaults`, which builder-state inference never reads. The constraint is documented instead; the type-level resolver stays simple.
