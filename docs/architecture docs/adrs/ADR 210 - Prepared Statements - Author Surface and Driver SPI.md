# ADR 210 — Prepared Statements: Author Surface and Driver SPI

## Status

Accepted. May 5, 2026.

## Overview

Executing a SQL DSL query end to end has three costs: lowering the relational AST to dialect SQL, encoding parameters for the wire, and the server parsing and planning the SQL. The first two are pure work in the framework; the third lives on the database. All three repeat on every `.execute()` call against the same query — a tight loop running the same lookup ten thousand times pays each one ten thousand times.

Two of those costs are amortizable. Lowering depends only on the AST, so the result can be cached. Most SQL servers can keep a parsed plan keyed by a name in the connection's session and reuse it on subsequent executions; the client sends `EXECUTE` once the plan is registered, skipping the parse.

The SQL DSL exposes one primitive that opts into both kinds of reuse: a *prepared statement*. The user calls `db.prepare(declaration, callback)` once and gets back a `PreparedStatement<Params, Row>` object. The runtime invokes the callback to obtain a plan, runs the `beforeCompile` middleware chain on it, lowers the result once, and freezes the lowered SQL onto the object. On first `.execute()` against a connection, the driver allocates whatever per-target handle it needs — a name, a statement reference, an integer, anything — and stores it back on the `PreparedStatement` through a slot wrapper. Subsequent executes reuse the lowered SQL and the handle until the connection ends.

The primitive lives on the runtime: the underlying call is `runtime.prepare(declaration, callback)`. It lives there because the `beforeCompile` middleware chain is owned and invoked by the runtime, and `prepare` has to run that chain so AST rewrites are baked into the lowered SQL. Each DB-specific facade (the Postgres client, the SQLite client, etc.) re-exposes `prepare(declaration, callback)` as a top-level convenience method that delegates to the runtime. The `db` proxy returned by `sql({ context })` itself is unchanged — it still maps top-level keys to user-defined tables and exposes nothing else.

There is no global cache. The lowered SQL lives on the user's `PreparedStatement` reference; the per-connection server-side state lives on the connection. When either ends, that state ends with it.

This ADR is family-level: it pins the author surface, the driver SPI shape, the lifetime model, and the retry contract. Per-driver caching strategies and per-driver staleness detection live in the drivers, not here.

## Grounding example

```ts
const ps = await runtime.prepare(
  { userId: 'pg/int4@1', email: 'pg/text@1' },
  (params) =>
    db.user
      .update({ email: params.email })
      .where((f, fns) => fns.eq(f.id, params.userId))
      .build(),
);

await ps.execute(runtime, { userId: 124, email: 'carl@example.com' });
await ps.execute(runtime, { userId: 125, email: 'dee@example.com'  });

await withTransaction(runtime, async (tx) => {
  await ps.execute(tx, { userId: 126, email: 'eve@example.com' });
});
```

A few things to notice:

- **`runtime.prepare(...)` is the underlying primitive.** Each DB-specific facade re-exposes it as a top-level convenience (`db.prepare(...)` on facades that surface one). The two surfaces have identical signatures and return the same object; the facade method exists so that simple call sites don't have to reach for the runtime explicitly.
- **The first argument declares the parameter shape.** Names mapped to codec ids drawn from the codec registry. The editor autocompletes the codec id strings; the type system rejects unknown ones.
- **The callback receives a `params` object whose values are bind-site references.** It is the *only* callback argument; the DSL root (`db`) is captured from the enclosing scope. `params.userId` flowing into `fns.eq(f.id, …)` slots in like any other expression — the type at that position is the same arm of `CodecExpression` that the DSL accepts wherever a literal would normally go (`eq`, `update`, `where` predicates, and so on). Slot reuse is implicit by reference equality: referring to `params.userId` twice is one slot used twice.
- **`.execute(target, params)` is typed end to end.** `Params` comes from the declaration via each codec's `TInput` mapping; `Row` comes from the plan returned by the callback.
- **The execution scope is always explicit.** The first argument is a `RuntimeQueryable` — the top-level runtime, an explicit connection, or an active transaction (or its `TransactionContext`). The same `PreparedStatement` redirects between them without re-preparation; there is no implicit binding back to the runtime that produced it.
- **The first execute allocates a server-side handle; the second reuses it.** Subsequent executes against the same connection skip both lowering and parsing.

Without `prepare`, an ad-hoc `db.user.select(...).where(...).all()` (or `.build()` + `runtime.execute(plan)`) runs as before: lowered every time, parsed by the server every time, and the framework keeps no state about it.

## Design principles

1. **Reuse is opt-in and explicit.** Two `prepare` calls with identical SQL produce two independent `PreparedStatement` handles. The framework does not deduplicate, does not maintain a global shape-keyed cache, and does not infer reuse from call patterns. Users hold the reference; users decide when to reuse.

2. **Cache lifetime equals the user's reference, bounded by connection lifetime.** The lowered SQL lives on the `PreparedStatement` object — when it goes out of scope, so does the cache. Server-side prepared-plan state lives on the connection — when the connection ends, the plan ends with it. There is no dispose path, because there is nothing for one to do beyond what these two natural boundaries already do.

3. **The runtime treats the handle as opaque.** The runtime has no concept of the handle's shape. It hands the driver a getter/setter slot and the driver fills it. This keeps the runtime agnostic to per-target preparation primitives, which differ widely across SQL dialects.

4. **The framework pins the retry contract; the driver picks the trigger.** When a cached plan goes stale on the server, the framework guarantees the user-visible behaviour: clear the slot, allocate a fresh handle, retry the execute exactly once, surface a stable error if the retry fails. *When* to do that — what signal counts as staleness — is per-target. The contract is symmetric across drivers; the trigger is asymmetric.

The rest of the document elaborates each principle.

## Author surface

### Where `prepare` lives

The primitive is `runtime.prepare(declaration, callback)`. It lives on the runtime because that is where the `beforeCompile` middleware chain is owned and run. `prepare` has to invoke that chain so any AST rewrites a middleware applies are baked into the lowered SQL — placing `prepare` anywhere else would mean either splitting the middleware chain across two homes or punting middleware work into the I/O path on first execute.

Each DB-specific facade re-exposes `prepare(declaration, callback)` as a top-level method that delegates to `this.runtime().prepare(...)`. The two surfaces have identical signatures and return the same object; the facade method exists so that everyday call sites can write `db.prepare(...)` without reaching for the runtime explicitly.

The `db` proxy returned by `sql({ context })` is unchanged. It still maps top-level keys to user-defined tables and exposes nothing else; there is no `db.prepare` on the proxy itself. Anchoring `prepare` to the facade rather than the proxy keeps the proxy's namespace pristine for user-defined names.

### `prepare(declaration, callback)`

`declaration` is a name-keyed object whose values are codec-id strings drawn from the codec registry. The long form `{ codecId, nullable: true }` is used when nullability differs from the default. The codec-id position is statically typed against the registry, so the editor autocompletes it and unknown ids fail to compile.

`Params` for `.execute(target, params)` is derived by looking each declared entry's codec up in the registry and using its `TInput` mapping, threading nullability through.

The callback receives `(params)` — a single argument. The DSL root (`db`) is captured from the enclosing scope rather than passed in, so the callback's only obligation is to turn declared params into a plan. Each `params.<name>` is a bind-site reference whose static type is `Expression<{ codecId; nullable }>` — the same arm of `CodecExpression` that the DSL accepts wherever a literal would go. Slot reuse is implicit by reference equality: if the callback refers to `params.userId` twice, that's one slot used twice. Literals not threaded through `params` get baked into the lowered SQL at lower time.

The callback MUST end with `.build()`, returning a plan. `Row` is derived from that plan's row type.

If a name in `declaration` isn't referenced by the callback's plan, `prepare` throws a stable error code under the `RUNTIME` namespace. (Type-level detection of unused declared params isn't achievable across the chained-builder type machinery; runtime detection is the contract.)

### `.execute(target, params)` takes an explicit target

`PreparedStatement.execute(target, params)` always names its execution scope. `target` is a `RuntimeQueryable` — the top-level `Runtime`, an explicit `RuntimeConnection`, or a `RuntimeTransaction` / `TransactionContext`. There is no default and no implicit binding back to the runtime that produced the statement.

`RuntimeQueryable` itself extends to require both `execute(plan)` and `executePrepared(ps, params)`. Each scope (runtime, connection, transaction, transaction context) implements `executePrepared` against the `SqlQueryable` it is backed by; the prepared statement is pure data and just delegates to the target.

This makes the same `PreparedStatement` reusable across scopes: prepare once at startup, and then run it against the runtime for one request, against an active transaction for another. Inside a transaction, `ps.execute(tx, params)` routes through the transaction's connection — a write earlier in the transaction is visible to the prepared lookup, and a rollback discards both. After the transaction ends, the same statement runs unchanged against the runtime.

The alternative — letting `.execute(params)` default to "the runtime that built me" — was rejected. It silently couples prepared statements to a specific scope, makes the transaction case ambiguous (does an outer-prepared statement see the tx's state?), and forces an awkward second API to redirect when the answer is "no". An explicit first argument carries no ambiguity and keeps the prepared statement object scope-free.

### Why `prepare` is async with no driver I/O

`prepare` performs no driver I/O. Internally it invokes the callback, awaits the async `beforeCompile` middleware chain on the resulting plan's AST so AST rewrites are baked into the lowered SQL, calls the adapter's `lower()`, and freezes the lowered SQL plus the parameter slot order onto the `PreparedStatement`. The handle slot starts unset.

The async return reflects an existing constraint, not a new one. `beforeCompile` is async-typed across the rest of the system. A sync `prepare` would force one of two compromises: split the chain into sync and async variants (inflating the hook surface), or defer the chain to first execute (defeating the "no I/O at prepare time" property by pushing middleware work into the I/O path). Returning `Promise<PreparedStatement<Params, Row>>` keeps the chain intact and costs one `await` at call sites. Driver I/O still happens only on `.execute()`.

### Capability gating

`prepare` is available on every SQL target with no contract capability flag. Lowering reuse is universal — every adapter's `lower()` is pure work that can be cached. The server-side reuse benefit is opportunistic: the driver may or may not deliver it, and may be told not to via the per-driver opt-out described below. Gating `prepare` on a capability would force users to inspect the contract before deciding whether to call a method whose API is identical regardless. The call is exposed unconditionally; the driver decides what to do underneath.

## Driver SPI

`SqlQueryable` gains one method:

```ts
interface PreparedExecuteRequest {
  readonly sql: string;
  readonly params: readonly unknown[];
  readonly handle: { get(): unknown | undefined; set(value: unknown): void };
}

interface SqlQueryable {
  // … existing methods …
  executePrepared(req: PreparedExecuteRequest): AsyncIterable<Row>;
}
```

The driver receives the lowered SQL, encoded params, and a slot wrapper — never the `PreparedStatement` object. The runtime constructs the slot wrapper around the `PreparedStatement`'s handle field; reads and writes flow through that single field on the user's object.

### Lazy handle allocation

The slot starts unset. On each call, the driver decides whether to allocate. The expected pattern is: read `req.handle.get()`; if undefined, mint a handle of the driver's choosing and call `req.handle.set(handle)`; thereafter, reuse the handle on calls against connections where the underlying server-side prepared plan is still valid.

Handle shape is the driver's choice and opaque to the runtime. The runtime never branches on the handle's shape, never logs it, and never compares two handles for equality. Allocation MUST be cheap and synchronous — the call sits inside an async-iterable execute path, and the framework guarantees no I/O cost for handle allocation itself. Beyond that, the driver is free.

### Why a slot wrapper

Pinning the driver's contact surface to a three-field record keeps the SPI minimal. Drivers cannot reach into the `PreparedStatement` to inspect declarations, ASTs, or middleware state, even by accident. The runtime owns the rest of the object and can evolve it (additional middleware metadata, debug fields) without touching the driver SPI.

The slot pattern also covers the case where a driver does not implement server-side reuse. Such a driver returns correct results without ever touching the slot — `executePrepared` becomes a one-shot parameterized query that ignores `req.handle`. The SPI shape is the same; only the body changes. The same path serves the explicit opt-out described later.

## Lifetime and memory

The `PreparedStatement` carries the lowered SQL text and (lazily) one opaque handle — nothing else. No parameter values, no row data. Server-side state lives on the connection; reusing a `PreparedStatement` across two connections gives each connection its own server-side entry, allocated on its first execute against that connection.

A `PreparedStatement` reused across two connections may end up with handles that are byte-identical or distinct, depending on what the driver finds convenient. The runtime makes no claims either way; consumers MUST NOT depend on either property.

Memory upper bound is roughly *(distinct PreparedStatements) × (live connections that have executed each)*, sized in low kilobytes per pair. Long-lived connections holding many `PreparedStatement` references will accumulate prepared-plan memory until the connection recycles. The cleanup mechanism is connection recycling; the system has no other dispose path (see [design principle #2](#design-principles)).

## Stale-handle retry

Server-side prepared plans outlive any single `.execute()` call. A schema migration can change a column type, an administrator can reset the session, or a connection-internal eviction can drop the plan — any of which leaves the cached plan out of sync with the server's view.

The framework guarantees one retry path:

- The driver detects the staleness signal — its mechanism, its detection sensitivity.
- On detection, the driver clears the slot and allocates a fresh handle (calls `req.handle.set(newHandle)` with a new value).
- The driver retries the execute exactly once.
- On retry success, the user observes one `.execute()` call that succeeded.
- On retry failure, the driver surfaces `ADAPTER.PREPARE_FAILED`, preserving the originating error as `cause`. The error envelope is defined by [ADR 027 — Error Envelope Stable Codes](./ADR%20027%20-%20Error%20Envelope%20Stable%20Codes.md), which reserves `ADAPTER.PREPARE_FAILED` for exactly this surface.

Detection sensitivity is a per-driver tradeoff. Some targets surface a clean signal that says "this prepared plan is gone"; the driver retries narrowly. Others have no such signal; the driver may treat any error originating from a cached execution as a candidate for re-prepare. In the second case the false-positive cost is one extra preparation, paid only on otherwise-failing executes — the bound is small and self-correcting. The framework neither prefers nor mandates either policy; it pins the contract (clear, allocate, retry once, surface) and leaves the trigger to the driver (see [design principle #4](#design-principles)).

The runtime never re-lowers on retry. The lowered SQL on the `PreparedStatement` is invariant for the lifetime of the statement; only the handle changes.

## Reuse opt-out: `preparedStatements: boolean`

Some deployment topologies cannot rely on server-side prepared-plan persistence. The most common case is a connection multiplexer or pooling proxy that may switch the underlying physical connection between calls — a plan registered on one physical connection isn't visible on the next, and the cached handle silently breaks. Whether server-side reuse is safe is a topology question, not a target-version question, so neither the contract nor the driver tries to auto-detect it.

The supported escape hatch is an explicit driver option: `preparedStatements: boolean`, default `true`. When `false`, `executePrepared` runs a one-shot parameterized query and leaves the handle slot unset. The lowered SQL on the `PreparedStatement` is still reused — that is the universal half of the benefit, independent of server-side preparation. Users keep the lowering reuse and lose the parse-skip; the tradeoff is explicit.

The driver does not auto-detect topology. Auto-detection is unreliable (greeting strings vary, transparent proxies exist) and shifts a correctness decision from configuration to heuristics. Users opt out explicitly and own the decision.

## Middleware

Three of the four SQL middleware hooks fire on the prepared path; one fires earlier than on the ad-hoc path:

- `beforeCompile` runs **once at `prepare` time**. AST rewrites change the lowered SQL, so they have to be baked in before the SQL is frozen on the `PreparedStatement`. Re-running per execute would defeat the cache — every execute would have to re-lower.
- `beforeExecute`, `onRow`, `afterExecute` run **per `.execute()` call**. They observe params and rows, which differ per execute, and never see the lowered SQL changing.

Ad-hoc `.execute()` is unchanged: all four hooks run as today. The single asymmetry — `beforeCompile` running at prepare time versus execute time — is the irreducible consequence of caching the lowered SQL.

## Non-goals

The following are deliberate exclusions, not omissions:

- **Global shape cache.** Two `prepare` calls with identical SQL produce two handles. Deduplication is the user's responsibility — they hold the reference, they decide whether to reuse it. A global cache would invert ownership and force lifetime decisions onto the framework (see [design principle #1](#design-principles)).
- **Cross-process or persistent caches.** All state is in-process and tied to live connections.
- **Cross-adapter reuse.** A `PreparedStatement` is bound to the runtime it was created from. The surface is SQL-only; non-SQL families do not have a `prepare` semantic.
- **Explicit dispose.** No `.dispose()` method. The leak is bounded and self-heals on connection recycle. A dispose method would require tracking which connections have seen which handles, which is the cache the system explicitly avoids.
- **Pre-warming server-side preparation at pool init.** First `.execute()` per connection pays the preparation cost. Pre-warming would require the framework to know the full set of `PreparedStatement`s ahead of time; the user-owned-handle model puts that knowledge on the user.
- **Observability surface for prepared-statement execution.** Tracing, metrics, counters, structured logs — drivers may add their own; the framework does not standardise one.
- **List/array parameter slots.** The codec registry has no list codecs; `prepare` accepts only scalar slots. The design accommodates list codecs without further changes — adding a list codec extends `prepare` to array-typed slots automatically.

## Alternatives considered

**A. Implicit / shape-keyed global cache.** Lowering happens automatically the first time a given AST is executed; subsequent identical ASTs reuse the lowered SQL. Rejected. Cache invalidation becomes a framework problem (how big? what eviction policy? what about middleware that mutates the AST per call?), and the win is opaque to users — they cannot tell whether a given call is hot or cold without instrumentation. The user-owned handle keeps lifetime where it can be reasoned about: at the call site.

**B. `prepare` returns synchronously.** Considered. Would require either splitting `beforeCompile` into sync and async variants or running middleware lazily on first execute. The first inflates the hook surface; the second defeats the "no I/O at prepare time" property by deferring middleware work into the I/O path. Async return matches the existing chain and costs one `await`.

**C. Driver receives the `PreparedStatement` directly.** Rejected. Pins the driver's contact surface to the entire object, which carries declarations, callback closure references, AST metadata, and middleware state. The slot-wrapper SPI keeps the surface to three fields and lets the runtime evolve the rest of the object freely. It also means a driver that does not implement server-side reuse can route through the same SPI by ignoring the slot — the same shape that the `preparedStatements: false` opt-out produces.

**D. Auto-detect topologies that do not support server-side reuse.** Rejected. Detection is unreliable across deployment topologies. Misdetecting in either direction is worse than asking users to flip a flag once: a false positive disables a real optimisation; a false negative causes runtime errors deep inside hot loops. The explicit option puts the decision where the deployment topology is known.

**E. Allocate the driver handle at `prepare` time.** Rejected. Forces driver I/O into a method whose contract is "no I/O", and mints handles for connections the statement may never reach. Lazy allocation on first execute matches the lifetime of the underlying server-side state and keeps `prepare` cheap, I/O-free, and idempotent.

**F. Mandate a single stale-detection policy across drivers.** Rejected. The detection signal is target-specific; the framework's job is to pin the contract (clear, allocate, retry once, surface), not to legislate a detection mechanism a target may not be able to provide. Symmetric policy at the contract level, asymmetric policy at the trigger level (see [design principle #4](#design-principles)).
