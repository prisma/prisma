# ADR 039 — Migration graph path resolution & integrity

## Context

Migrations are modeled as directed edges from `fromHash` to `toHash`. At apply time, the runner must compute a path from the database's current contract hash to the desired hash using the set of on-disk edges. The graph tolerates cycles (e.g., rollback migrations C1→C2→C1) — BFS pathfinding uses visited-node tracking to handle them safely. Ordering is determined entirely by graph topology; named refs (`migrations/<space>/refs/<name>.json`) provide multi-environment targeting. See also [ADR 169 — On-disk migration persistence](ADR%20169%20-%20On-disk%20migration%20persistence.md).

## Problem

- Multiple developers create edges concurrently, producing branches
- Ambiguous or conflicting edges can lead to non-deterministic path selection
- Cycles in the graph (e.g., rollback migrations) must not cause infinite loops in pathfinding
- Without a consistent tie-breaker, two environments may choose different valid paths
- Orphan edges and unreachable nodes accumulate without guardrails

## Goals

- Deterministic, repeatable path selection between any two hashes
- Linear-time detection of cycles and orphans during graph load
- Stable tie-breaking across machines and CI
- Simple complexity profile suitable for local runs and CI
- Clear error codes and diagnostics when integrity is violated

## Non-goals

- Weighted optimization of path cost beyond hop count
- Automatic graph surgery or edge rewriting
- Encoding business policies into the graph layer

## Decision

### Graph model and index

**Default mode: Reconstruct from migration files**
- Each migration file (`migration.json`) carries its own manifest with metadata: `{ edgeId, from, to, opsHash, createdAt, labels?, archived? }`
- Graph is reconstructed on demand from migration file headers
- This is the source of truth - no separate ledger required
- `edgeId = sha256(from + to + opsHash)` unless tooling assigns it
- Loader builds adjacency maps `out[from]` and `in[to]` from `migration.json` manifests

**Optional: Performance cache with `graph.index.json`**
- maintain graph index JSON in repo: `migrations/graph.index.json`
- Pre-materialized adjacency lists for faster pathfinding on large migration graphs
- Purely a performance optimization - can be regenerated anytime from migration files
- Under the squash-first policy (ADR 102), most teams maintain small migration graphs (10-20 active edges) where reconstruction is fast and the index is unnecessary

### When to use a committed index (optional)

The graph index is a lockfile optimization that teams can adopt later. **Most teams won't need this initially** when following squash-first hygiene (ADR 102).

The index acts like a lockfile for the migration graph. It's helpful if you have:
- Large migration histories you haven't squashed yet
- Lots of concurrent branches and frequent parallel edges
- Compliance requirements for reviewable "graph diff" artifacts
- External tools (PPg, visualizers) operating without repo access

Benefits when enabled:
- Stable neighbor ordering pre-materialized
- Auditability via small JSON diff
- Fast cold starts (no reconstruction needed)
- Canonical `createdAt` and labels (not inferred from FS)

Not a conflict with reconstruction:
- Planner can reconstruct on every invocation by default
- On load, tooling verifies file digests match index
- If stale, fail with `ERR_MIG_GRAPH_INDEX_STALE`
- Small repos use ephemeral mode: rebuild each run, cache locally

**Default recommendation**: Start without an index. Enable only if telemetry shows reconstruction cost or compliance requires reviewable artifacts.

### Integrity checks on load

- **Same source and target check**: a self-edge (`from == to`) is rejected with `MIGRATION.SAME_SOURCE_AND_TARGET` unless the migration carries at least one `data`-class operation. Self-edges with data ops are first-class (pure data migrations on the current contract hash). See [ADR 001 §Self-edges](ADR%20001%20-%20Migrations%20as%20Edges.md) and [ADR 208](ADR%20208%20-%20Invariant-aware%20migration%20routing.md).
- **Cycle detection**: DFS with color marking, reported as `WARN_MIG_GRAPH_CYCLE` for diagnostics. Cycles are tolerated at runtime — BFS pathfinding uses visited-state tracking to avoid infinite loops (see §Path computation below). See ADR 169 §3.
- **Parallel edge policy**: two edges with same `(from, to)` but different `opsHash` require label `parallel-ok`, else `ERR_MIG_GRAPH_PARALLEL_EDGE`
- **Orphan edge detection**: edges unreachable from any genesis or that lead to no declared target are flagged as `WARN_MIG_ORPHAN_EDGE` (excludes edges marked `archived: true`)
- **Dangling target detection**: `to` with no inbound edges and not a genesis is `ERR_MIG_GRAPH_DANGLING_TARGET`
- **Genesis set**: `{EMPTY_DB_HASH}` plus declared baselines labeled `baseline`

### Path computation

- **Default**: reconstruct graph from edge file manifests in-memory
- `findPath(graph, from, to)` uses BFS to compute minimal-hop paths over adjacency list. Complexity O(V+E).
- `findPathWithInvariants(graph, from, to, required)` extends the BFS to invariant-aware routing — returns the shortest path whose edges' `invariants` sets collectively cover `required`, or `null`. State-level dedup over `(node, coveredSubset)` is required for correctness; node-only dedup misses paths whose first arrival covered the wrong subset. The covered subset is a `Set<string>` of invariant ids; the dedup key is `${node}\0${[...covered].sort().join('\0')}`. When `required = ∅` the implementation delegates to `findPath` so behaviour is byte-identical for callers that don't thread invariants. See [ADR 208](ADR%20208%20-%20Invariant-aware%20migration%20routing.md) for performance characterisation and the full algorithm.
- Neighbour ordering is owned by neighbour generation, not by a separate sort step — invariant-aware ordering depends on the source state's still-needed set, and that dependency can't be separated from where neighbours are produced. When `required ≠ ∅`, edges that cover at least one still-needed invariant are explored before edges that don't, with the deterministic tie-break below as the secondary key. When `required = ∅`, ordering matches `findPath` exactly.
- With squash-first policy (ADR 102), typical V+E < 50, making this trivial
- Optional index pre-materializes adjacency for performance at scale

### Deterministic tie-breaking

Neighbor ordering is deterministic whether using reconstruction or index. Metadata comes from migration file headers (`migration.json`), not the index. The index merely caches this for faster access.

Neighbor processing order is stable by a sort key tuple:
1. (Invariant-aware BFS only, when `required ≠ ∅`) edge's `invariants` overlap the still-needed set: covering edges first
2. Label priority: `main < default < feature`
3. `createdAt` ascending
4. `to` lexicographic
5. `migrationHash` lexicographic

If labels are absent the order falls back to the remaining keys. Key (1) applies only inside `findPathWithInvariants`; structural `findPath` ignores it (preserving byte-for-byte routing parity for callers that don't thread invariants).

### Graph version and caching

- `graphVersion = sha256(sorted(migrationHash, from, to, opsHash))`
- The runner uses `(currentHash, desiredHash, graphVersion)` in cache keys
- Any index change invalidates cached paths deterministically

> **Terminology note.** This ADR's body uses `edgeId` in places where the code uses `migrationHash` — the same content-addressed hash. `migrationHash` covers `providedInvariants` as well (see [ADR 169 §3](ADR%20169%20-%20On-disk%20migration%20persistence.md), [ADR 199](ADR%20199%20-%20Storage-only%20migration%20identity.md)).

### Orphans and parallel edges policy

- Orphans are warnings by default and can be enforced as errors in CI
- Parallel edges are allowed only with `parallel-ok` labels and deterministic preference via tie-break

### Diagnostics

- Stable error codes with minimal subgraph rendering and remediation suggestions
- `migrate graph lint` and `migrate graph prune` commands surface issues and clean up orphans

## Consequences

### Positive
- Deterministic paths across environments
- Early detection of cycles and malformed edges
- Reviewable, portable graph state for CI/PPg
- Simple performance characteristics
- Simple default: no index overhead for small/medium repos
- Squash-first policy (ADR 102) keeps migration graph small, reducing need for index

### Negative
- Optional index adds maintenance overhead if enabled
- Teams using index must regenerate after adding migrations

## Mitigations

- Tooling owns index lifecycle: `migrate create` updates the index, `migrate graph update` regenerates deterministically
- The planner refuses to use a stale index by default and offers `--refresh`

## Alternatives considered

- **Pure reconstruction on every run (chosen as default)**: Works well with squash-first hygiene (ADR 102). Small migration graphs make reconstruction negligible. Committed index available as opt-in for scale/compliance.
- **Timestamp-only tie-breaking**: Sensitive to clock skew and FS semantics. Rejected in favor of multi-key deterministic sort.
- **Always require committed index**: Adds complexity for teams that don't need it. Index remains available as performance optimization.

## Implementation notes

- Implement `graph.index.json` writer/reader with file digest table
- Extend CLI with `migrate graph update`, `migrate graph lint`, `migrate graph prune`
- Loader verifies index freshness and returns actionable errors
- Telemetry records `graphVersion` with each apply for reproducibility

## Testing

- Fixtures with branches, orphans, parallel edges, cycles
- Golden tests that identical inputs yield identical index and paths
- Scale tests for O(V+E) behavior
- CI tests that fail on stale index and pass after graph update
