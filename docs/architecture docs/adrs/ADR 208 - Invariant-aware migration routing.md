# ADR 208 — Invariant-aware migration routing

## At a glance

A team member adds a `phone` column to `users`, wants to enforce `NOT NULL`, and wants production to route through a backfill before reaching the new contract. The migration declares the backfill as a routing-visible invariant via `invariantId`:

```ts
// migrations/20260424T1030_add_phone_notnull/migration.ts (schematic; query bodies elided)
import { addColumn, Migration, MigrationCLI, setNotNull } from '@internal/postgres/migration';
import endContract from './end-contract.json' with { type: 'json' };

export default class AddPhoneNotNull extends Migration {
  override describe() {
    return { from: '…', to: '…' };
  }

  override get operations() {
    return [
      addColumn('public', 'users', {
        name: 'phone', typeSql: 'text', defaultSql: '', nullable: true,
      }),

      // Routing-visible — refs can require this invariant.
      this.dataTransform(endContract, 'Backfill users.phone', {
        invariantId: 'backfill-user-phone',
        check: () => /* … select users where phone is null */,
        run:   () => /* … update those rows to set phone   */,
      }),

      // Path-dependent cleanup; no invariantId, not addressable from refs.
      this.dataTransform(endContract, 'Trim trailing whitespace', {
        check: () => /* … */,
        run:   () => /* … */,
      }),

      setNotNull('public', 'users', 'phone'),
    ];
  }
}
MigrationCLI.run(import.meta.url, AddPhoneNotNull);
```

Production declares which data invariants it requires by listing them on the ref:

```json
// migrations/refs/prod.json
{ "hash": "…", "invariants": ["backfill-user-phone"] }
```

`migrate --to prod` then routes through a path that provides the named invariant — applying the schema change *and* the backfill — and records `backfill-user-phone` on the marker on success. A second `migrate --to prod` against the same database short-circuits to a structural BFS, because marker subtraction empties the effective required set.

If the ref names an invariant that no migration in the graph provides *and* the marker has not already recorded it, the CLI fails with `MIGRATION.UNKNOWN_INVARIANT` before invoking the pathfinder. If the invariant exists but no path to the target hash covers it, the CLI fails with `MIGRATION.NO_INVARIANT_PATH` and shows the structural fallback path so the author can see why.

## Decision

### Identity: `name` for retry/ledger, `invariantId?` for routing

`DataTransformOperation` carries two distinct identifiers:

- **`name`** is human-readable and identifies the operation for retry / ledger purposes. Renaming it does not affect routing.
- **`invariantId?: string`** is optional. When set, the transform is *routing-visible* — refs may require that id, and the routing layer reasons about it. When unset, the transform is path-dependent and not addressable from refs.

The split lets a routing-relevant rename (`invariantId`) be a deliberate, reviewable change with a clear blast radius, while everyday display-text edits to `name` stay safe.

### Manifest aggregate: `providedInvariants`

A migration's manifest carries `providedInvariants: string[]` — the set of `invariantId`s declared by data transforms in its `ops.json`. The aggregate is derived from ops at emit time and re-derived from `ops.json` whenever a migration is loaded from disk; the load fails with `MIGRATION.PROVIDED_INVARIANTS_MISMATCH` if the manifest's stored aggregate disagrees with what the ops actually contain.

The aggregate is part of the manifest's content-addressed hash ([ADR 169](./ADR%20169%20-%20On-disk%20migration%20persistence.md) §3), so an edit to any `invariantId` ripples through the migration's identity.

### Edges carry invariants

`MigrationEdge.invariants` is populated from the manifest's `providedInvariants` at graph-reconstruction time. The graph layer never re-derives from ops — the manifest is the source of truth.

### Routing: `findPathWithInvariants` and `FindPathOutcome`

`findPathWithInvariants(graph, from, to, required)` is the invariant-aware extension of the structural BFS. Given a target hash and a set of required invariant ids, it returns the shortest path whose edges' `invariants` collectively cover `required`, or `null` if no such path exists. When `required` is empty it delegates to `findPath`, so non-invariant-aware callers see byte-identical behaviour.

`findPathWithDecision` wraps this primitive and returns a discriminated `FindPathOutcome`:

| `kind` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Path exists covering `required`; the decision carries selection metadata. |
| `unreachable` | No structural path `from → to` exists in the graph. |
| `unsatisfiable` | Structurally reachable, but no path covers every required invariant. The outcome carries `structuralPath` (the empty-required structural path, for diagnostics) and `missing` (required ids not covered on that fallback). |

The pathfinder owns the structural-fallback BFS for the unsatisfiable case. Callers consume `outcome.missing` and `outcome.structuralPath` directly when surfacing `MIGRATION.NO_INVARIANT_PATH` — they don't run a second BFS.

### Marker: applied-at-least-once, not currently true

`prisma_contract.marker` carries an `invariants` field — a set of ids that records which invariants have been successfully applied to this database at least once in its history.

The field is **set-semantic** and **monotonic**: every successful apply unions the migration's `providedInvariants` into it; no flow ever shrinks it. Two distinct authorities answer two distinct questions:

- The data transform's `check` answers *"does the data satisfy this invariant right now?"*
- The marker answers *"has a migration that provides this invariant been applied at least once?"*

These are not the same claim. The marker doesn't reverify the data on rollback or restoration; it records application history, which the data transform's `check` (re-run on every apply) reverifies separately when the data changes.

### Server-side merge for marker invariants

The marker write is atomic per storage family. No client-side compare-and-set loop on `invariants`:

- **Postgres** — the `UPDATE` uses a single self-referential expression that reads, unions, dedupes, and writes the column under the row lock:
  ```sql
  invariants = array(select distinct unnest(invariants || $N::text[]) order by 1)
  ```
- **MongoDB** — `findOneAndUpdate` with an aggregation pipeline (`$setUnion + $sortArray`); document-level atomic.
- **SQLite** — the runner reads, unions, and writes inside `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`, sharing the migration's transaction. SQLite has no native text-array merge.

`invariants: []` on a write is a no-op merge — preserves the existing set, doesn't clobber.

### CLI marker subtraction makes `--to` idempotent

Before routing, `migrate --to` and `migration status --to` compute:

```
effectiveRequired = ref.invariants − marker.invariants
```

The pathfinder receives `effectiveRequired`, not `ref.invariants`. When all of a ref's invariants are already in the marker, `effectiveRequired` is empty and routing falls through to the structural BFS — second applies are byte-identical to non-invariant-aware behaviour.

### `MIGRATION.INVARIANTS_PENDING` covers the in-between

A database can be at the ref's structural target hash *and* missing invariants the ref requires (the migration was never run with this ref; ref was edited to add a new invariant; etc.). `migration status --to` surfaces this as an info diagnostic with code `MIGRATION.INVARIANTS_PENDING` rather than reporting "up to date" — the user is not at the desired state.

### `providedInvariants` flows through the plan envelope

`MigrationApplyStep.providedInvariants` carries the manifest's aggregate from the control-api boundary into the runner; runners read `options.plan.providedInvariants ?? []` for marker writes and self-edge no-op detection. There is no separate runner option for invariants — the manifest aggregate is the single source of truth, and the load-time integrity check (re-derive from ops + recompute the migration hash, both performed when the migration is read from disk) is what ensures the manifest agrees with the ops it claims to summarise.

Self-edges (data-only migrations against the same contract hash) are covered in [ADR 001 §Self-edges](./ADR%20001%20-%20Migrations%20as%20Edges.md); the routing-side rule is that a self-edge carrying a required invariant is a covering edge.

## Why the marker, not the ledger

The marker and the ledger answer different categories of question, and that distinction governs which one stores the applied-invariants set.

The **marker** is the database's own statement of what the framework has confirmed about it — a framework-issued *guarantee record*. `storageHash` and `profileHash` already record "this database is at contract C with capability profile P"; `invariants` extends the same record with "…and these named data-transform invariants have been applied." The runner is the only writer; the rest of the framework reads the marker to decide whether a plan is applicable, whether a ref is satisfied, and what work routing still has to do.

The **ledger** is an *audit artifact* — an append-only log of what happened, when, and by whom. Its lifecycle belongs to the user (compliance retention, log compaction, manual cleanup); the framework never assumes a particular row is still there.

Framework decisions about applicability and routing must never depend on the audit log. "These invariants have been applied" is a guarantee the framework provides about the database, so it belongs on the guarantee record. Reading it from a log the user is free to truncate would tie routing correctness to ledger retention policy — a category error.

## Performance

`findPathWithInvariants`'s worst case is `O((V + E) · 2^k)` where `k` is the number of required invariants — each node can be reached once per distinct covered subset. The covered subset is a `Set<string>` of invariant ids; the BFS dedup key is `${node}\0${[...covered].sort().join('\0')}`.

In practice, `effectiveRequired` collapses `k` toward zero in steady state. The dominant case is a stick-shaped or mostly-stick migration graph with `k = 0` (ref unchanged → short-circuits to `findPath`) or `k = 1` (one new invariant per change). Measured wall times on a developer laptop:

| Case | k | Wall time |
|---|---:|---:|
| `stick(n=1000)` | 1 | 0.50 ms |
| `mostly-stick(spine=1000, 5% branch rate)` | 1 | 0.55 ms |
| `mostly-stick(spine=1000, 5% branch rate)` | 2 | 1.20 ms |

Pathological inputs (high feature-branch density with many required invariants) follow the `2^k` curve — `branchy(spine=1000, density=0.05)` reaches ~80 ms at `k = 8` and ~8.7 s at `k = 16`. Materialising those inputs requires either a fresh database catching up to a long-applied ref or a ref edited extensively without ever being applied; neither is typical.

The algorithm has no refusal threshold and the encoding has no length cap. If real usage pushes routine `k > 20`, a different approach — heuristic A*, dominance pruning, or precomputed reach sets per invariant — would replace the current BFS.

## Alternatives considered

### Ledger-side storage of the applied-invariants set

Record `(migrationId, invariants)` per applied ledger row, derive the applied set by reading the ledger.

Rejected because:

- Routing would depend on a writable, user-owned audit log (the principled objection — see "Why the marker, not the ledger").
- Requires a new ledger-read SPI surface across both storage families.
- Drags MongoDB's ledger up to parity with the SQL ledger, which is its own workstream.
- Pays for per-migration provenance — a real benefit — that the routing layer doesn't consume.

The principled objection stands even if the surface costs were already paid. Per-migration provenance is a separable feature: the ledger can grow it later as audit data without becoming the source of truth for routing.

### Graph-derived snapshot of the applied-invariants set

Compute the applied set on the fly by walking `root → marker` in the graph and unioning declared `providedInvariants` from each edge.

Rejected as correctness-breaking. It assumes the database actually traversed every edge on the structural root-to-marker path. The `db update` flow (which advances the marker without going through migrations) violates that assumption: any graph-derived applied set would over-claim invariants the database has never actually been subjected to.

### A separate runner option channel for invariants

Have the runner accept invariants through an option (e.g. `MigrationRunner.execute({ invariants })`), independent of the manifest.

Rejected because the manifest's `providedInvariants` is the canonical source and the load-time integrity check already enforces consistency between the aggregate and the ops it claims to summarise. A parallel option channel adds a second source of truth for a property the framework already guarantees, and a "forgot to thread the option" footgun on top.

## Decision record

`invariantId` is the opt-in routing key on data transforms; the marker stores the monotonic union of applied invariants via storage-family-atomic merge; `findPathWithDecision` discriminates `unreachable` from `unsatisfiable`; the CLI computes `effectiveRequired = ref.invariants − marker.invariants` before routing; and the manifest's `providedInvariants` is the single source of truth, threaded into runners through the plan envelope and verified at load time.
