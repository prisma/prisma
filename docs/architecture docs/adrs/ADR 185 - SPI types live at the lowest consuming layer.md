# ADR 185 — SPI types live at the lowest consuming layer

## At a glance

During emission, the framework orchestrates and family-specific packages
customize. The interface between them — `EmissionSpi` — is an SPI
(Service Provider Interface): defined once, consumed by the orchestration
layer, implemented by each family.

```text
  @internal/emitter (tooling layer — calls the hook)
        ↓ imports
  @internal/framework-components/emission (core layer — defines the SPI)
        ↑ imports                    ↑ imports
  @internal/sql-contract-emitter   @internal/mongo-emitter
  (tooling layer — implements)        (tooling layer — implements)
```

Both the caller and the implementers depend on the abstraction. The
abstraction lives in the lowest layer that can host it — **core**, not
foundation (where `@internal/contract` lives), because the SPI types
reference `OperationRegistry` and other core-layer types.

## Context

Prisma Next's packages are organized into layers with a strict import rule:
a package may only import from its own layer or lower layers.

```text
foundation → core → authoring → tooling → runtime
```

An SPI (Service Provider Interface) is an interface that lower-layer code
*calls* and higher-layer code *implements*. This is the inverse of a normal
API, where the definer also calls it. SPIs arise when framework orchestration
needs to delegate family-specific behavior — the orchestration lives in a
lower layer, but each family's implementation lives in a higher layer.

The emission pipeline is the primary example: the emitter's `emit()`
function (tooling layer) delegates type generation to the family via
`EmissionSpi` callbacks (`generateStorageType`, `generateModelsType`,
etc.). Each family provides its own implementation — `sqlEmission`
(SQL emitter, tooling layer), `mongoEmission` (Mongo emitter, tooling
layer).

## Decision

**SPI interfaces live in the lowest layer whose types they depend on.**

The emission SPI types live in `@internal/framework-components` (core
layer), exported via the `./emission` subpath:

- `EmissionSpi` — the interface family emitters implement to customize
  type generation during emission (storage types, model types, imports,
  type aliases, and contract wrapper)
- `GenerateContractTypesOptions` — options for contract `.d.ts` generation
  (parameterized renderers, query operation imports)
- `TypeRenderEntry`, `TypeRenderer`, `ParameterizedCodecDescriptor` —
  supporting types for parameterized codec rendering

Orchestration code imports from this subpath:

```ts
// tooling layer — emitter (caller)
import type { EmissionSpi } from '@internal/framework-components/emission';

export async function emit(
  contract: Contract,
  stack: EmitStackInput,
  targetFamily: EmissionSpi,
): Promise<EmitResult> { ... }
```

Family emitters implement the interface:

```ts
// tooling layer — SQL emitter (implementer)
import type { EmissionSpi } from '@internal/framework-components/emission';

export const sqlEmission: EmissionSpi = {
  id: 'sql',
  generateStorageType(contract, storageHashTypeName) { ... },
  generateModelStorageType(modelName, model) { ... },
  getFamilyImports() { ... },
  getFamilyTypeAliases(options) { ... },
  getTypeMapsExpression() { ... },
  getContractWrapper(contractBaseName, typeMapsName) { ... },
};
```

This is the dependency inversion principle applied at package boundaries:
both the caller and the implementer depend on the abstraction, and the
abstraction lives at its own natural layer — determined by its type
dependencies, not by who implements it.

The same pattern applies to other SPI types already in
`@internal/framework-components`: component descriptors
(`./components`), control-plane types (`./control`), and execution-plane
types (`./execution`).

## Why not the alternatives?

**Colocate with implementations (tooling layer)?** The emitter (tooling
layer) needs to import `EmissionSpi` as a parameter type. Both the
emitter and family implementations share the same SPI types from core.

**Place in `@internal/contract` (foundation layer)?**
`EmissionSpi` references `GenerateContractTypesOptions` and other
core-layer types. This would force the contract package to depend on a
core-layer package, turning a leaf foundation package into one with
framework-domain coupling.

## Consequences

- **Contract is a true leaf**: `@internal/contract` depends only on
  `@internal/utils` and `arktype` — no framework-domain packages.
- **No upward imports**: Orchestration code imports SPI types from core,
  never from tooling.
- **Single canonical source**: Each SPI type has one definition; no
  duplicates across packages.
- **Counter-intuitive placement**: Contributors may instinctively move SPI
  types "closer" to their implementations. The
  `@internal/framework-components` README documents this rationale to
  prevent drift.

## Status

Accepted.
