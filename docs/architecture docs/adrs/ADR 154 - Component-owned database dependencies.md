# ADR 154 — Component-owned database dependencies

## Status

**Superseded by [ADR 212 — Contract spaces](./ADR%20212%20-%20Contract%20spaces.md)** (TML-2397). The `databaseDependencies` mechanism described below was removed from the framework — schema-contributing extensions now use the per-space planner / runner / verifier described in ADR 211, and codec-driven per-field schema work is described in [ADR 213 — Codec lifecycle hooks](./ADR%20213%20-%20Codec%20lifecycle%20hooks.md). The body of this ADR is preserved unchanged for historical context; the "Supersession" section at the bottom captures what changed.

## Context

Some framework components (targets, adapters, extensions) require database-side persistence structures that are not part of the core contract storage model, for example:

- Postgres extensions (`CREATE EXTENSION …`)
- Auxiliary schemas
- Functions / operators
- Other catalog-level prerequisites

Historically, it’s tempting to encode this knowledge in targets (e.g., hardcoding `pgvector → vector`) or to infer it from `contract.extensions`. Both approaches couple low-level components to ecosystem details and lead to fragile “fuzzy matching” logic.

## Decision

Model database-side prerequisites as **component-owned database dependencies**, declared on **framework component descriptors** and consumed uniformly by:

- migration planning (`db init` planner)
- migration execution (runner + post-apply schema verification)
- pure schema verification over schema IR

The CLI passes a **list of configured framework components** (`frameworkComponents`) into planning/execution/verification. SQL-family code structurally narrows the components that declare `databaseDependencies` and consumes their declared dependency metadata.

The target architecture is that components own both:

- dependency declaration (`id`, `label`, `install` ops), and
- dependency verification logic (pure schema-IR evaluation that determines whether the dependency is installed).

### Key constraints

- **No inference from `contract.extensions`**: schema verification must not interpret `contract.extensions` as database prerequisites.
- **No fuzzy matching**: matching component IDs to database facts via string heuristics is forbidden. Dependencies must be declared explicitly by components.
- **Pure verification**: dependency verification must be a pure function over the in-memory `SqlSchemaIR` (no DB I/O).
- **Idempotent install operations**: dependency install operations are migration operations with pre/post checks; they must be safe to include in an init plan.

## Model

### Database dependency

A component can declare `databaseDependencies.init`, where each dependency provides:

- a stable `id` (e.g., `postgres.extension.vector`)
- a human `label`
- `install` operations (`SqlMigrationPlanOperation`) for `db init`
- (future target architecture) component-owned verification logic (pure over `SqlSchemaIR`) that determines installed-state for that dependency

Planner and verifier stay structural consumers: they avoid target-level fuzzy matching or inference from `contract.extensions`.

### Schema IR representation

`SqlSchemaIR` carries a target-agnostic `dependencies: readonly DependencyIR[]` array, where `DependencyIR = { readonly id: string }`. This replaces the earlier Postgres-specific `extensions: readonly string[]` field.

- **Introspection** (online path): the adapter maps database objects to dependency IDs. For Postgres, `pg_extension` rows are mapped using the convention `postgres.extension.<extname>`.
- **`contractToSchemaIR`** (offline path): dependency IDs are collected from active framework components' `databaseDependencies.init[].id`.
- **Planner** (current v1): uses dependency-ID presence (`requiredId ∈ schemaIR.dependencies`) to decide skip/emit for dependency install ops.

### Data sources

This ADR distinguishes three concepts:

- **Framework extensions / packs**: registered via config; their identity and namespace appear in `contract.extensions` for type/codec/operation namespacing.
- **Database dependencies** (`DependencyIR`): a target-agnostic node in `SqlSchemaIR` representing an installed prerequisite. Populated by introspection (online) or `contractToSchemaIR` (offline).
- **Component database dependencies**: the bridge between components and schema facts, declared by components. The dependency `id` matches the `DependencyIR.id` in the schema IR.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Targets stay “thin”: no target-specific maps for ecosystem components.
- Verification is deterministic: no fuzzy matching or hidden inference.
- `db init` becomes data-driven: adding/removing components changes planned dependency ops predictably.

### Negative / tradeoffs

- Callers must consistently pass the active `frameworkComponents` list to planner/runner/verification.
- Adapters still own the base introspection surfaces and conventions used to materialize schema facts (for example, Postgres `pg_extension` -> `postgres.extension.<extname>`).

### Current implementation compromise (v1)

The current implementation intentionally simplifies verification to adapter-owned ID-presence checks:

- `ComponentDatabaseDependency` no longer includes a per-dependency verify callback.
- Planner and schema verification currently use `requiredId ∈ schemaIR.dependencies`.
- For Postgres today, `schemaIR.dependencies` is populated from adapter-owned `pg_extension` introspection (`postgres.extension.<extname>`).
- This works for the current dependency set because all active dependencies are extension-shaped and map cleanly from `pg_extension`.

This is a temporary compromise, not the target architecture. When non-extension dependency shapes emerge (for example, prerequisites represented by functions, settings, or catalog/table facts), we should restore component-owned verification through component-contributed detectors/hooks that project installed-state facts into `SqlSchemaIR.dependencies`, while keeping planner/verifier matching structural.

### Known limitation (accepted for now)

The v1 model is intentionally narrow and has a known source-of-truth limitation:

- **Live path** (`db update`, `db verify`, `db verify --schema-only`): dependency IDs come from adapter introspection of the database.
- **Offline path** (`migration plan`): dependency IDs are synthesized from currently active `frameworkComponents`.

This means offline dependency evidence is currently composition-coupled and not a first-class projection derived from historical `fromContract` dependency state. The model is acceptable for extension-shaped presence checks today, but insufficient for richer extension-owned dependency semantics (for example, auth plugins that require structural or behavioral invariants beyond ID presence).

Related design issue: planner inputs are asymmetric (`from` as `SqlSchemaIR`, `to` as contract), which increases the risk that dependency semantics stay distributed across code paths instead of being represented in one canonical diff surface.

## Supersession

[ADR 212 — Contract spaces](./ADR%20212%20-%20Contract%20spaces.md) replaces the `databaseDependencies` mechanism with a uniform per-space planner / runner / verifier surface. The relevant differences from the v1 model captured above:

- **Schema visibility.** Extensions declare their owned schema in a `contract.json` of their own (a "contract space"). The verifier aggregates loaded spaces in memory and checks the live database against the union — extension-installed objects are no longer "extras" the verifier has to be told to ignore via the `databaseDependencies.installs.{tables,schemas}` allowlist.
- **No fuzzy matching, no `pg_extension` introspection.** The "current implementation compromise (v1)" in this ADR — adapter-owned ID-presence checks against `pg_extension` rows mapped to `postgres.extension.<extname>` — is removed. Adapters fully participate in the per-space verifier without a dependency-tree node; `SqlSchemaIR.dependencies` is gone.
- **No `dependency_missing` SchemaIssue.** The same diagnostic is now reported through ADR 212's per-space verifier as `EXTENSION_HEAD_REF_DRIFT` / `EXTENSION_HEAD_REF_MISSING` (or one of `verifyContractSpaces`'s five structural violation kinds), each carrying an actionable remediation hint.
- **Schema-driven per-column work.** The narrow case `databaseDependencies.init` was sometimes used for — schema-driven per-column scaffolding (e.g. cipherstash registering each searchable column with EQL) — is covered by [ADR 213 — Codec lifecycle hooks](./ADR%20213%20-%20Codec%20lifecycle%20hooks.md).

The migration story is demonstrated end-to-end by:

- **pgvector** (the only workspace consumer of `databaseDependencies` confirmed by the TML-2397 spike) — ported from `databaseDependencies.init` to a `contractSpace` with a `vector` type in its `contract.json` and `CREATE EXTENSION vector` as the body of one migration op. See `packages/3-extensions/pgvector/`.
- **cipherstash** — authored greenfield directly on the contract-space mechanism. See `packages/3-extensions/cipherstash/`.

After both extensions migrated, `ComponentDatabaseDependencies`, `ComponentDatabaseDependency`, and the `databaseDependencies?` field on `SqlControlExtensionDescriptor` were removed from the framework.
