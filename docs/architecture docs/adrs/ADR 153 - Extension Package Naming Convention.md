## Context

The extension pack naming convention previously allowed two patterns for npm package names:

- `@internal/ext-<name>` (shorter form)
- `@internal/extension-<name>` (longer form)

This was documented in `docs/reference/Extension-Packs-Naming-and-Layout.md` with a preference stated for the shorter `ext-` prefix for brevity. However, having two accepted patterns creates ambiguity and inconsistency:

1. **Discoverability**: Users searching for packages may not find all extensions if some use `ext-` and others use `extension-`.
2. **Consistency**: Other package prefixes in the project use full words (`adapter-`, `driver-`, `target-`) rather than abbreviations.
3. **Clarity**: The full `extension-` prefix immediately communicates the package's purpose without requiring knowledge of the abbreviation convention.

## Decision

Use `@internal/extension-<name>` exclusively for all extension pack npm package names.

The `ext-*` pattern is deprecated and should not be used for new packages.

### Examples

| Package Purpose | Correct Name | Incorrect Name |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| pgvector support | `@internal/extension-pgvector` | `@internal/ext-pgvector` |
| PostGIS support | `@internal/extension-postgis` | `@internal/ext-postgis` |
| SQL views | `@internal/extension-sql-views` | `@internal/ext-sql-views` |

## Rationale

1. **Consistency with other prefixes**: Aligns with `adapter-postgres`, `driver-postgres`, `target-postgres` which all use full words.

2. **Single source of truth**: One pattern eliminates ambiguity in documentation, tooling, and user expectations.

3. **Clarity over brevity**: The few extra characters in `extension-` vs `ext-` provide clearer intent and are negligible in practice.

4. **npm search and discovery**: Users can search for `@internal/extension-` to find all extensions reliably.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear, unambiguous naming convention
- Better discoverability via npm search
- Consistent with existing package naming patterns
- Easier onboarding for new contributors

### Negative

- Slightly longer import paths (negligible)

### Migration

No migration required — the existing `@internal/extension-pgvector` package already follows this convention. Documentation has been updated to reflect the single-pattern approach.
