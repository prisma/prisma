# Code generation & Node.js setup

## TLDR

In order to use Prisma Client JS in your application, you must install the `@prisma/client` package in your application:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

The `@prisma/client` package itself is a [_facade package_](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js/issues/261) (basically a _stub_) that doesn't contain any functional code, such as types or the Prisma Client JS runtime. When installing the `@prisma/client` package, its `postinstall` hook is being executed to invoke the `prisma2 generate` command and generate the actual Prisma Client JS code into the facade package at `node_modules/@prisma/client`.

This means the Prisma 2 CLI needs to be available as well. It is typically installed as a development dependency:

```
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

## Why is the facade package needed if Prisma Client JS is generated?

The facade package is necessary to enable typical build and deployment workflows of Node.js applications. As an example, the facade package ensures that Prisma Client JS survives the ["pruning"](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/prune.html) that's often employed by Node.js package managers.

Note that you'll need to re-execute `prisma2 generate` whenever you make changes to your [Prisma schema](../prisma-schema-file.md) (or perform the changes while are you're running Prisma's [development mode](../development-mode.md).

> **Note**: While this approach has a number of [benefits](#why-is-prisma-client-js-generated-into-node_modulesgenerated-by-default), it is also unconventional and can be a source of confusion for developers new to Prisma Client JS. Using `node_modules/@prisma/client` as the default `output` for Prisma Client JS is still experimental.

## Specifying the target location for Prisma Client JS

`prisma2 generate` invokes the [generators](../prisma-schema-file.md#generators-optional) specified in the [Prisma schema file](../prisma-schema-file.md) and generates the respective packages on the respective output path(s).

The default Prisma Client JS generator can be specified as follows in your schema file:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Note that this is equivalent to specifying the default `output` path:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./node_modules/@prisma/client"
}
```

When running `prisma2 generate` for either of these schema files, Prisma Client JS package will be located in:

```
node_modules/@prisma/client
```

You can also specify a custom `output` path on the `generator` configuration, for example:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./src/generated/client"
}
```

## Prisma Client JS should be viewed as an npm package

Node.js libraries are typically installed as npm dependencies using `npm install`. The respective packages are then located inside the [`node_modules`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders#node-modules) directory from where they can be imported into application code.

Because Prisma Client JS is a custom API for _your specific database setup_, it can't follow that model. It needs to be generated locally instead of being installed from a central repository like npm. However, the mental model for Prisma Client JS should still be that of an Node.js module.

## Why is Prisma Client JS generated into `node_modules/@prisma/client` by default?

### Importing Prisma Client JS

By generating Prisma Client JS into `node_modules/@prisma/client`, you can import it into your code:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
```

or

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
```

### Keeping the query engine binary out of version control by default

Prisma Client JS is based on a _query engine_ that's running as a binary alongside your application. This binary is downloaded when `prisma2 generate` is invoked and stored in the `output` path (right next to the generated Prisma Client JS API).

By generating Prisma Client JS into `node_modules`, the query engine is kept out of version control by default (since `node_modules` is typically ignored for version control). If it was not generated into `node_modules`, then developers would need to explicitly ignore it, e.g. for Git they'd need to add the `output` path to `.gitignore`.

## Generating Prisma Client JS in the `postinstall` hook of `@prisma/client`

The `@prisma/client` package defines its own `postinstall` hook that's being executed whenever the package is being installed. This hook invokes the `prisma2 generate` command which in turn generates the Prisma Client JS code into the default location `node_modules/@prisma/client`. Notice that this requires the Prisma 2 CLI to be available, either as local dependency or as a global installation (it is recommended to always install the `@prisma/cli` package as a development dependency, using `npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev`, to avoid versioning conflicts though).
