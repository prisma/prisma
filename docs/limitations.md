# Current limitations

During the Preview period of Prisma 2 there are missing features, limited performance and stability issues you should be aware of:

## Functionality limitations

- Embedded types are not implemented yet ([tracking issue](https://github.com/prisma/lift/issues/43))
- Many other types are not fully implemented yet
- Models must have an `@id` attribute and it must take one of these forms:
    - `Int @id`
    - `String @id @default(uuid())`
    - `String @id @default(cuid())`  
- When [introspecting](./introspection.md) a database, Prisma for now only recognizes many-to-many relations that follow the Prisma conventions for [relation tables](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/relations.md#mn).
- Some edge cases for complex nested mutations don't work properly yet.
- Non-interactive terminals (like Git Bash on Windows) are currently not supported by Prisma2 CLI ([tracking issues](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/554))

## Stability limitations

- Limited auto-complete in TypeScript projects due to a compiler bug ([tracking issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30507) over at `TypeScript`, and the [PR we raised that fixes that](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32100) and waits to get merged)

## Performance limitations

- Prisma currently processes only 1 request at a time, there is no parallelism during the early preview period. ([This will be fixed before GA, follow along in this issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/420))

## Out of scope functionality

The following functionality is currently not part of Prisma and will most probably not be added before GA:

- Realtime API or subscriptions (In the future (after GA), Prisma will have an events engine that might enable this feature, but there is no ETA for this yet) ([tracking issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/298))
- Go client ("Photon Go") ([tracking issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/571))
