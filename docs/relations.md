# Relations

This is an extension of the [data modeling](./data-modeling.md) chapter that discusses _relations_ in the data model definition in detail.

The examples on this page are based on this [schema file](./prisma-schema-file.md):

```groovy
// schema.prisma

datasource mysql {
  url      = "file:data.db"
  provider = "sqlite"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id
  posts     Post[]
  profile   Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id   Int    @id
  user User
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id
  author     User
  categories Category[]
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id
  posts Post[]
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

> Note that here all [scalars](./data-modeling.md/#scalar-types) been removed from the [example data model](./data-modeling.md/#example) so you can focus on the relations.

It contains the following relations:

- 1:1: `User` <-> `Profile`
- 1:n: `User` <-> `Post`
- m:n: `Post` <-> `Category`

## The `@relation` attribute

The `@relation` attribute disambiguates relationships when needed.

It has the following signature:

```groovy
@relation(_name: String?, references: Identifier[]?, onDelete: OnDeleteEnum?)
```

- `references` _(optional)_: List of [field](./data-modeling.md#fields) names to reference.
- `name` _(optional)_: Defines the _name_ of the relationship. If this a m:m-relation, the name also determines the name of the relation table in the underlying database.
- `onDelete` _(optional)_: Defines what to do when the referenced relation is deleted.
  - `NONE` (_default_): Set the field to `null`.
  - `CASCADE`: Also delete this entry.

> **Note**: Cascading deletes are not yet implemented. You can track the progress of this feature in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/267).

## 1:1

The return value on both sides is a nullable single value. Prisma prevents accidentally storing multiple records in the relation.

```groovy
model User {
  id        Int      @id
  profile   Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id   Int    @id
  user User
}
```

For 1:1 relationships, it doesn't matter on which side you store the foreign key. Prisma has a convention that the foreign key is added to the model which appears _first alphanumerically_ in your data model. In the example above, that's the `Profile` model.

Under the hood, the tables looks like this:

| **User** |         |
| -------- | ------- |
| id       | integer |

| **Profile** |         |
| ----------- | ------- |
| id          | integer |
| user        | integer |

You can use the `@relation` attribute to explicitly determine the side of the relation on which the foreign key should be stored. If you prefer storing it in the `User` table instead of the `Profile` table, you can use achieve this as follows:

```groovy
model User {
  id        Int      @id
  profile   Profile? @relation(references: [id])
}

model Profile {
  id   Int    @id
  user User
}
```

Now, the tables are structured liks this:

| **User** |         |
| -------- | ------- |
| id       | integer |
| profile  | integer |

| **Profile** |         |
| ----------- | ------- |
| id          | integer |

You _may_ omit either `User.profile` or `Profile.user` and the relationship will remain intact. This makes either the back-relation or the forward-relation optional. If one side of the relation is missing, Prisma implies the field name based on the name of the model it is pointing to.

If you're introspecting an existing database and the foreign key does not follow the alphanumeric convention, then Prisma uses the [`@relation`](#the-relation-attribute) attribute to clarify.

```groovy
model User {
  id        Int        @id
  customer  Profile?   @relation(references: id)
}

model Profile {
  id    Int     @id
  user  User?
}
```

## 1:n

The return value on one side is a optional single value, on the other side a list that might be empty.

```groovy
model User {
  id        Int      @id
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id
  author     User
}
```

In this example, `Post.author` points to the primary key on `User`.

Connectors for relational databases will implement this as two tables with a
foreign key constraint on the `Post` table:

| **User** |         |
| -------- | ------- |
| id       | integer |

| **Post** |         |
| -------- | ------- |
| id       | integer |
| author   | integer |

You may omit `Post.author` and the relationship will remain intact. If one
side of the relation is missing, Prisma implies the field name based on the name
of the model it is pointing to. If you omitted `User.posts`, Prisma would add
an implicit `User.post` field, making the relation `1:1` instead of `1:n`.

## m:n

The return value on both sides is a list that might be empty. This is an improvement over the standard implementation in relational databases that require the application developer to deal with implementation details such as an intermediate table / join table. In Prisma, each connector will implement this concept in the way that is most efficient on the given storage engine and expose an API that hides the implementation details.

```groovy
model Post {
  id         Int        @id
  categories Category[]
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id
  posts Post[]
}
```

## Self-relations

Prisma supports self-referential relations:

```groovy
model Employee {
  id         Int       @id
  reportsTo  Employee
}
```

This results in the following table:

| **Employee** |         |
| ------------ | ------- |
| id           | integer |
| reportsTo    | integer |

## Relations in the generated Photon API

The [generated Photon API](./photon/api.md) comes with many helpful features for relations (find examples below):

- Fluent API to traverse relations on the returned object
- Nested creates, updates and connects (also referred to as _nested writes_) with transactional guarantees
- Nested reads (eager loading) via `select` and `include`
- Relation filters (a filter on a related object, i.e. a JOIN is performed before the filter is applied)

### Fluent API

The fluent API lets you _fluently_ traverse the relations of your models via function calls. Note that the last the model of the _last_ function call determines what is being returned from the entire request.

This request returns all posts by a specific user:

```ts
const postsByUser: Post[] = await photon.users
  .findOne({ where: { email: 'ada@prisma.io' } })
  .posts()
```

This request returns all categories by a specific post:

```ts
const categoriesOfPost: Category[] = await photon.posts
  .findOne({ where: { id: 1 } })
  .categories()
```

### Nested writes (transactions)

Nested writes provide a powerful API to write relational data to your database. They further provide _transactional guarantees_ to create, update or delete data accross multiple tables in a single Photon.js API call. The level of nesting of a nested writes can be arbitrarily deep.

Nested writes are available for relation fields of a model when using the model's `create` or `update` function. The following nested write operations are available per function:

- On to-one relation fields (e.g. `profile` on `User` in the sample data model above)
  - `create`
    - `create`: Create a new user and a new profile
    - `connect`: Create a new user and connect it to an existing profile
  - `update`
    - `create`: Update an existing user by creating a new profile
    - `connect`: Update an an existing user by connecting it to an existing profile
    - `update`: Update an existing user by updating their existing profile
    - `upsert`: Update an existing user by updating their existing profile or by creating a new profile
    - `delete` (only if relation is optional): Update an existing user by deleting their existing profile
    - `disconnect` (only if relation is optional): Update an existing user by removing the connection to their existing profile
- On to-many relation fields (e.g. `posts` on `User` in the sample data model above)
  - `create`
    - `create`: Create a new user and one or more new posts
    - `connect`: Create a new user and connect it to one or more existing posts
  - `update`
    - `create`: Update an existing user by creating one or more new posts
    - `connect`: Update an existing user by connecting it to one or more existing posts
    - `set`: Update an existing user by replacing their existing posts with one or more existing posts
    - `disconnect`: Update an existing by removing the connection(s) to one or more of their existing posts
    - `update`: Update an existing user by updating one or more of their existing posts
    - `delete`: Update an existing user by deleting one or more of their existing posts
    - `updateMany`: Update an existing user by updating one or more of their existing posts
    - `deleteMany`: Update an existing user by deleting one or more of their existing posts
    - `upsert`: Update an existing user by updating one or more of their existing posts or by creating one or more new posts

Here are some examples of nested writes:

```ts
// Create a new user with two posts in a
// single transaction
const newUser: User = await photon.users.create({
  data: {
    email: 'alice@prisma.io',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'Join the Prisma Slack on https://slack.prisma.io' },
        { title: 'Follow @prisma on Twitter' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

```ts
// Change the author of a post in a single transaction
const updatedPost: Post = await photon.posts.update({
  where: { id: 5424 },
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

```ts
// Remove the author from an existing post in a single transaction
const post: Post = await photon.posts.update({
  data: {
    author: { disconnect: true },
  },
  where: {
    id: 'ck0c7jl4t0001jpcbfxft600e',
  },
})
```

For the next example, assume there's another model called `Comment` related to `User` and `Post` as follows:

```prisma
model User {
  id       String    @default(cuid()) @id
  posts    Post[]
  comments Comment[]
  // ...
}

model Post {
  id         String     @default(cuid()) @id
  author     User?
  comments   Comment[]
  // ...
}

model Comment {
  id        String @default(cuid()) @id
  text      String
  writtenBy User
  post      Post
  // ...
}

// ...
```

Because there are circular relations between `User`, `Post` and `Comment`, you can nest your write operations arbitrarily deep:

```ts
// Create a new post, connect to an existing user and create new,
// comments, users and posts in deeply nested operations
const post = await photon.posts.create({
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: {
        email: 'alice@prisma.io',
      },
    },
    comments: {
      create: {
        text: 'I am Sarah and I like your post, Alice!',
        writtenBy: {
          create: {
            email: 'sarah@prisma.io',
            name: 'Sarah',
            posts: {
              create: {
                title: 'Sarah\'s first blog post',
                comments: {
                  create: {
                    text: 'Hi Sarah, I am Bob. I like your blog post.',
                    writtenBy: {
                      create: {
                        email: 'bob@prisma.io',
                        name: 'Bob',
                        posts: {
                          create: {
                            title: 'I am Bob and this is the first post on my blog',
                          }
                        },
                      },
                    },
                  },
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }
})
```

### Nested reads (eager loading)

You can eagerly load relations on a model via `select` and `inlcude` (learn more about the difference [here](./photon/api.md#manipulating-the-selection-set)). The nesting of eagerly loaded relations can be arbitrarily deep.

```ts
// The returned post objects will only have the  `id` and
// `author` property which carries the respective user object
const allPosts = await photon.posts.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    author: true
  },
})
```

```ts
// The returned posts objects will have all scalar fields of the `Post` model 
// and additionally all the categories for each post
const allPosts = await photon.posts.findMany({
  include: {
    categories: true
  },
})
```

```ts
// The returned objects will have all scalar fields of the `User` model 
// and additionally all the posts with their authors with their posts
await photon.users.findMany({
  include: {
    posts: {
      include: {
        author: {
          include: {
            posts: true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Relation filters

A relation filter is a filter operation that's applied to a related object of a model. In SQL terms, this means a JOIN is performed before the filter is applied.

```ts
// Retrieve all posts of a particular user
// that start with "Hello"
const posts: Post[] = await photon.users
  .findOne({
    where: { email: 'ada@prisma.io' },
  })
  .posts({
    where: {
      title: { startsWith: 'Hello' },
    },
  })
```
