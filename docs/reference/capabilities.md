# Capabilities Reference

This document defines the canonical capability keys and reserved namespaces used throughout Prisma Next for adapter negotiation, feature gating, and extension integration.

Capabilities describe **what the database environment can do**. Adapters report capabilities at connect time, and the runtime negotiates them with extension packs. The contract only **declares requirements** (`contract.capabilities`) and pins the resulting `profileHash`; it does not define capabilities.

## Adapter (database) capabilities

Adapter-reported features of the database runtime. These are not contract-owned; they are discovered and negotiated.

### `sql`
Common SQL features reported by adapters using the `sql` namespace. This is a naming convention for shared SQL keys, not a separate “SQL family” capability set.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `lateral` | boolean | Supports LATERAL joins | Stable |
| `returning` | boolean | Supports RETURNING clauses for DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) | Stable |
| `jsonAgg` | boolean | Supports JSON aggregation functions | Stable |
| `enums` | boolean | Supports native enum storage types | Stable |
| `foreignKeys` | boolean | Supports FOREIGN KEY constraint DDL | Stable |
| `checkConstraint` | boolean | Supports CHECK constraint DDL. Gates the `@@check` authoring surface: a PSL contract declaring a check against an adapter that does not report this is refused at authoring. | Stable |
| `autoIndexesForeignKeys` | boolean | Database automatically creates indexes for foreign keys | Stable |
| `defaultInInsert` | boolean | Supports `DEFAULT` as a value in multi-row `INSERT ... VALUES` (e.g. `INSERT INTO t (a, b) VALUES (1, DEFAULT)`). When false, the ORM splits multi-row inserts by column signature so each statement has a uniform column list. | Stable |

### `postgres`
PostgreSQL-specific capabilities managed by the adapter.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `partialIndex` | boolean | Supports partial/filtered indexes | Stable |
| `deferrableConstraints` | boolean | Supports DEFERRABLE constraints | Stable |
| `savepoints` | boolean | Supports savepoint transactions | Stable |
| `transactionalDDL` | boolean | Supports transactional DDL | Stable |
| `explainFormat` | enum | EXPLAIN output format (`text` \| `json`) | Stable |

### `mysql`
MySQL-specific capabilities managed by the adapter.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `jsonFunctions` | boolean | Supports JSON functions | Stable |
| `generatedColumns` | boolean | Supports generated columns | Stable |
| `checkConstraints` | boolean | Supports CHECK constraints | Stable |
| `explainFormat` | enum | EXPLAIN output format (`text` \| `json`) | Stable |

### `sqlite`
SQLite-specific capabilities managed by the adapter.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `json1` | boolean | Supports JSON1 extension | Stable |
| `fts5` | boolean | Supports FTS5 full-text search | Stable |
| `rtree` | boolean | Supports R*Tree spatial indexing | Stable |

### Example adapter reports
Postgres adapters should always report `sql.lateral: true` and `sql.returning: true`. MySQL and SQLite should report those as `false` unless the adapter can prove otherwise.

Postgres (example):
```json
{
  "sql": { "lateral": true, "returning": true, "jsonAgg": true, "enums": true, "foreignKeys": true, "autoIndexesForeignKeys": false },
  "postgres": { "partialIndex": true, "transactionalDDL": true, "explainFormat": "json" }
}
```

MySQL (example):
```json
{
  "sql": { "lateral": false, "returning": false, "jsonAgg": false, "enums": false },
  "mysql": { "jsonFunctions": true, "generatedColumns": true, "explainFormat": "text" }
}
```

## Extension pack capabilities

Extension capabilities are prefixed by pack namespace to avoid collisions. These are negotiated alongside adapter capabilities at connect time.

### `pgvector`
PostgreSQL vector extension capabilities.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `ivfflat` | boolean | Supports IVFFlat indexing | Stable |
| `hnsw` | boolean | Supports HNSW indexing | Stable |
| `vector` | object | Vector type support with params | Stable |

### `postgis`
PostGIS geospatial extension capabilities.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `gist` | boolean | Supports GiST spatial indexing | Stable |
| `geography` | boolean | Supports geography type | Stable |
| `geometry` | boolean | Supports geometry type | Stable |
| `srid` | array | Supported SRID values | Stable |

### `pg_trgm`
PostgreSQL trigram extension capabilities.

| Capability | Type | Description | Stability |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `trigram` | boolean | Supports trigram similarity | Stable |
| `gin` | boolean | Supports GIN trigram indexes | Stable |

## Reserved Namespaces

The following namespaces are reserved and cannot be used by extension packs:

### Core Namespaces
- `prisma` - Reserved for Prisma core features
- `core` - Reserved for core adapter capabilities
- `internal` - Reserved for internal implementation details
- `sql` - Reserved for common SQL capability keys reported by adapters

### Adapter Namespaces
- `postgres` - PostgreSQL adapter capabilities
- `mysql` - MySQL adapter capabilities
- `sqlite` - SQLite adapter capabilities
- `mongodb` - MongoDB adapter capabilities (future)

### System Namespaces
- `system` - System-level capabilities
- `debug` - Debug and development capabilities
- `test` - Testing and validation capabilities

## Capability Key Rules

### Naming Convention
- Use lowercase with underscores or camelCase within namespaces (`jsonAgg`, `partial_index`)
- Boolean capabilities use simple names: `lateral`, `savepoints`
- Complex capabilities use descriptive names: `explainFormat`, `transactional_ddl`

### Stability Contract
- **Stable**: Core capabilities that cannot change meaning or be removed
- **Deprecated**: Capabilities marked for removal with migration path
- **Experimental**: New capabilities under evaluation

### Versioning
- Capability keys are immutable once published
- New capabilities can be added as stable
- Breaking changes require new capability keys

## Capability Negotiation

### Adapter Advertisement
Adapters declare supported capabilities at connect time:

```typescript
interface AdapterCapabilities {
  [namespace: string]: {
    [capability: string]: boolean | string | object | array
  }
}
```

### Contract Requirements
Contracts declare required capabilities in `contract.capabilities`:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "sql": { "lateral": true, "returning": true },
    "postgres": { "transactionalDDL": true },
    "pgvector": { "ivfflat": true }
  }
}
```

### Negotiation Process
1. Adapter advertises available capabilities (discovered from the database environment)
2. Runtime checks contract requirements against adapter capabilities
3. Missing required capabilities cause connection failure
4. Optional capabilities are noted but don't block connection

### Error Codes
- `E_CAPABILITY_MISSING` - Required capability not available
- `E_CAPABILITY_INCOMPATIBLE` - Capability value incompatible
- `E_CAPABILITY_UNKNOWN` - Unknown capability key

## Extension Pack Guidelines

### Namespace Selection
- Use descriptive, lowercase names: `pgvector`, `postgis`, `pg_trgm`
- Avoid generic terms: `vector`, `geo`, `search`
- Check reserved namespaces before publishing

### Capability Declaration
- Declare all capabilities your pack requires
- Use stable capability keys from this reference
- Document capability requirements in pack README

### Compatibility Matrix
- Test against multiple adapter versions
- Document minimum capability requirements
- Provide fallback behavior for missing capabilities

## Future Extensions

### Planned Capabilities
- `pg_stat_statements` - Query statistics
- `pg_hint_plan` - Query plan hints
- `pg_partman` - Partition management
- `timescaledb` - Time-series extensions

### Community Guidelines
- Follow naming conventions
- Document capability requirements
- Provide migration paths for capability changes
- Submit capability keys for review before publishing
