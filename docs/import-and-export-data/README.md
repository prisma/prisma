# Importing and exporting data

As the Prisma Framework currently doesn't provide a way to import and export data from/into a database, the documents in this folder describe **native import/export flows** for the databases that are supported by Prisma:

- [Importing and exporting data with PostgreSQL](./postresql.md)
- [Importing and exporting data with MySQL](./mysql.md)
- [Importing and exporting data with SQLite](./sqlite.md)
