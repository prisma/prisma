# Migration user journeys

The load-bearing user journeys the migration surface is designed around. Each names the persona, the question they are trying to answer, the verb sequence, and where the journey is exercised end-to-end.

Treat this doc as a companion to the [domain README](./README.md): the README defines the vocabulary; this doc shows the vocabulary in use, sequenced into the workflows real users walk through. Pathological / single-feature regression scenarios (drift edge cases, resolver internals, single-verb integration probes) live in the `test/integration/test/cli-journeys/` suite but are not catalogued here — they are not load-bearing as user stories.

The journeys are grouped by the user's *posture*, not by namespace:

- **Authoring** — at a keyboard, evolving the contract
- **Operating** — actually changing a live database
- **Reading** — interrogating the state of things
- **Adopting** — bringing pre-existing state into the migration graph
- **Recovering** — undoing or reconciling history

The CLI verb taxonomy ([namespacing rule](./README.md#namespacing-rule-subject-not-surface)) intentionally cuts across postures: a single posture pulls verbs from several namespaces. That is correct — the namespaces describe what a verb's *subject* is, not what the user's posture is.

## Authoring

### Bootstrap a new project

**Persona:** application developer starting fresh.
**Question:** "How do I get from `pnpm init` to a project that can talk to a database?"

```bash
prisma orm init        # scaffold project (schema.psl, config, etc.)
contract emit           # produce contract.json + contract.d.ts
db init                 # lay down marker + ledger tables in an empty DB
```

After `db init` the database is signed against the initial contract and ready for either dev iteration (`db update`) or first-migration authoring.

**Exercised by:** `test/integration/test/cli-journeys/init-journey.e2e.test.ts`, `greenfield-setup.e2e.test.ts`.

### Dev inner loop

**Persona:** application developer iterating on the schema.
**Question:** "I'm changing the contract often; how do I keep my local DB in sync without producing migration files I'd throw away?"

```bash
# edit schema.psl or the TS contract
contract emit
db update               # off-graph reconciliation; rebuild from desired state
```

`db update` is *not* the dev-DB equivalent of `migrate`. It does not produce a migration, does not walk the graph, does not advance a ref. It tears down and rebuilds the database to satisfy the current contract. That makes it the right verb during iteration (no junk migrations in the PR) and the wrong verb for anything reaching production (no audit trail; destructive).

A rewind during iteration is also `db update --to <contract>` — same verb, parameterised by target.

**Exercised by:** `db-update-workflows.e2e.test.ts` (Direct + Destructive), `interleaved-db-update.e2e.test.ts`.

### Plan and promise

**Persona:** application developer ready to commit a schema change to a PR.
**Question:** "I'm done iterating; how do I turn this dev state into a migration the team can review, and declare 'this PR advances production to the new state'?"

```bash
# contract.json reflects the new desired state
migration plan --advance <ref>  # diff the ref's contract against current,
                                # scaffold the migration package,
                                # advance the ref in one act
# review the generated migration.ts, edit ops if needed
migration compile               # lower migration.ts -> ops.json (if you edited)
```

This is the "freeze + promise" verb: producing the migration package and writing the ref pointer are one act, committed in one PR. `ref set` exists as the rarely-used direct-write escape hatch (creating a new ref, or correcting a wrong pointer after the fact) — the normal authoring path is `migration plan --advance <ref>`.

`migration new` is the sibling for hand-authored migrations: scaffolds an empty package with `from`/`to` set, ops blank, ready for the user to write by hand.

> **Status:** `--advance <ref>` is the resolved authoring path in the domain model but is not yet implemented in `migration plan`. Tracked under [TML-2560](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2560).

**Exercised by:** `schema-evolution-migrations.e2e.test.ts`, `multi-step-migration.e2e.test.ts`, `migration-plan-details.e2e.test.ts`, `migration-round-trip.e2e.test.ts`.

## Operating

### Migrate a database to a ref

**Persona:** operator running CD, or application developer pointing a fresh DB at a known state.
**Question:** "Where should this database be, and how do I get it there?"

```bash
migrate --to <ref>      # walk the graph from marker to the ref's contract,
                        # execute each migration on the path
```

This is the dominant CD operation. The verb is dead-simple by design: the *only* question the verb answers is "what state should the DB be in?", and the answer is a ref name. The directional vocabulary (`--to`) is reserved for `migrate`; signing the marker is a static claim and uses different vocabulary ([see `db sign`](./README.md#verbs)).

`migrate` is forward-only. It walks the directed graph from the current marker to the ref. Backward motion is not a `migrate` mode — that's `db update --to <contract>` (off-graph rebuild, destructive, dev-only).

**Exercised by:** `schema-evolution-migrations.e2e.test.ts`, `multi-step-migration.e2e.test.ts`, every journey that lands a real schema change.

### Continuous deployment

**Persona:** CD pipeline (or the operator monitoring it).
**Question:** "What will run on merge, and is that what we want?"

The CD signal is a three-part flow:

```bash
migration check         # graph integrity: every migration self-consistent,
                        # every edge's from/to lines up, no orphans,
                        # no dangling refs. Read-only, no DB.
migration status --from <contract>  # offline preview of the deploy path
migrate --to production  # the actual execution
```

The preview is required to be **rock solid** — it is the go/no-go signal. `migration check` covers artifact and graph integrity; `migration status --from` previews the deploy path. Both are fully offline: diffing runs against on-disk contract snapshots, so there is no sandbox execution and no shadow database will ever exist. The behavioural half of the question is enforced at apply time — the runner checks each operation's pre/post invariants and the destination hash, and refuses to advance the marker on violation.

**Exercised by:** `migration-check.e2e.test.ts` (integrity); the operational side rolls up through every end-to-end migration journey.

## Reading

### Status landing

**Persona:** anyone wondering what's going on.
**Question:** "Where is this database right now, and what's pending?"

```bash
migration status                   # the single landing pad
migration status --to <ref>        # path & pending against a target
migration status --from <contract> # offline mode; ignore the live DB
```

This is the load-bearing CI/CD question and the most-likely "I just got dropped into a repo and want to orient myself" verb. It is live but offline-capable via `--from`.

**Exercised by:** `migration-status-diagnostics.e2e.test.ts`.

### Pre-deploy review

**Persona:** db admin (or reviewer in PR review).
**Question:** "What's about to run against the database, and what does each step do?"

```bash
migration log                # applied history from the ledger; live
migration list               # flat enumeration of migration packages; offline
migration graph              # relational view of the graph; offline
migration graph --dot        # DOT output for renderers
migration show <m>           # single migration's full detail; offline
```

These four verbs answer different shapes of the same question — they share a common subject (migrations and their relationships) but differ in framing. Each verb's `--help` cross-references the others under a *See also* section so the reader can pivot quickly.

**Exercised by:** the catalogue above is exercised piecewise by `migration-graph-dot.e2e.test.ts`, `migration-show-reachability.e2e.test.ts`, and the various journey tests that print logs.

### Verification

**Persona:** anyone before doing something risky, or after suspecting something is wrong.
**Question:** "Is the world in the state I think it's in?"

Two distinct verification verbs, two distinct questions:

| Verb | What it verifies | Touches live DB? |
|---|---|---|
| `db verify` | Live DB satisfies its contract | Yes (read-only) |
| `migration check [<m>]` | Migration artifact / graph integrity | No |

The two are deliberately separately named — sharing `verify` across both would make "which verification?" the question at every call site. There is no sandbox-execution verb: no shadow database will ever exist, so a migration's behaviour is enforced during the real apply (pre/post invariants, destination-hash check), not previewed in a sandbox. See the [glossary entry for `migration check`](../../../glossary.md#migration-check) for the per-PN-code breakdown of what graph-integrity covers.

**Exercised by:** `migration-check.e2e.test.ts`.

## Adopting

### Brownfield: bring an existing database into the graph

**Persona:** application developer adopting Prisma Next on a database that already has schema and data.
**Question:** "I have a real database with real tables. How do I start managing it with migrations without nuking it?"

```bash
# point the CLI at the existing DB
contract infer            # introspect -> derive a contract that matches the DB
# review/edit the inferred contract.json
db sign                   # write the marker: 'this DB satisfies <contract>'
# from here, the normal author + migrate flow applies
```

The contract becomes the graph's root node (an `∅`-from migration is not produced — brownfield contracts simply exist as graph nodes the marker points at). Subsequent contract changes go through the normal `migration plan` / `migrate --to <ref>` flow.

Step-count ergonomics for this path are a tracked concern — the underlying steps are correct but the user-facing sequence is currently more verbs than it should be. Follow-up: [TML-2561](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2561) (brownfield adoption ergonomics).

**Exercised by:** `brownfield-adoption.e2e.test.ts` (happy path + mismatch case), `contract-infer-workflow.e2e.test.ts`.

### Adopting migrations on production

**Persona:** operator enabling the migration workflow on a database that's been running without it.
**Question:** "We've been using `db update` (or no Prisma Next at all) on production; how do we switch to managing it with migrations from now on?"

```bash
# on the running DB
contract infer            # capture current production state as a contract
# commit the contract; review it
db sign --contract <contract>   # marker now points at the captured state
# subsequent PRs author migrations forward from this point
migration plan --advance production
```

The trick is that the production DB and the inferred contract must already match — `db sign` performs no structural changes and refuses if the DB does not already satisfy the contract. That is the safety pivot the verb is named for.

**Exercised by:** `adopt-migrations.e2e.test.ts`.

## Recovering

### Roll back via forward migration

**Persona:** application developer or operator whose live DB needs to go back to an earlier state.
**Question:** "We need to undo a migration that's already been applied. How?"

```bash
# in the schema
# rewrite contract back to the earlier shape (e.g. via git revert of schema)
contract emit
migration plan --advance <ref>    # produces a new forward migration
                                   # whose to-contract is the earlier shape
# review the generated ops carefully; they describe how to *undo*
migrate --to <ref>                # apply forward
```

The mental model maps to `git revert`: we never reverse-execute a migration; we author a *new forward migration* whose `to`-contract is the earlier contract. The graph stays a DAG, the ledger gets a new row, and the rollback is itself reviewable in PR.

For *dev* rewinds (no ledger entry needed), `db update --to <contract>` does the same job destructively and off-graph.

**Exercised by:** `rollback-cycle.e2e.test.ts`.

### Reconcile a divergence between branches

**Persona:** two application developers, each working on a branch off the same contract.
**Question:** "We both authored migrations from the same base; what happens when both branches merge?"

Three shapes the merge can take, all valid:

- **Converging paths** — both migrations are compatible. Either order works; the second to merge is rebased onto the new tip and gets its `from` updated. Both end up in the graph as siblings of the shared base, then one chains off the other.
- **Diamond convergence** — the graph genuinely has two paths from the same root that meet again later. The model supports this; `migration graph` shows the diamond.
- **Same-base divergence with conflict** — both migrations target the same column/table in incompatible ways. The second PR's `migration check` fails with a structured error; the author rebases the contract on top of the merged tip and re-runs `migration plan`.

The graph is content-addressed: migration hashes change when ancestry changes, but the rules for "does this migration make sense from this contract?" are encoded in the verb taxonomy (`migration check`'s PN codes), not in branch ordering.

**Exercised by:** `diamond-convergence.e2e.test.ts`, `divergence-and-refs.e2e.test.ts`.

## What this doc deliberately does not cover

- **Mechanics of individual verbs.** Argument grammars, exit codes, output shapes — see the [domain README](./README.md) and `prisma orm <verb> --help`.
- **The full e2e test suite.** Drift edge cases, resolver internals, single-verb regression probes, error-envelope golden tests — these live in `test/integration/test/cli-journeys/` but are not load-bearing as user stories.
- **Extension-author workflows.** Authors of new contract spaces follow a parallel surface (contract-space namespaces, pinned mirrors). That surface is captured separately in `docs/architecture docs/subsystems/7. Migration System.md`.
- **Disaster recovery and squashing.** Squashing the migration graph, baselining from `∅`, recovering from a corrupted ledger — these are operational topics tracked separately and not part of the day-to-day user surface.
