# OSS posture

This directory documents the **policies and posture** that govern Prisma Next as an open-source project — how decisions are made, how dependencies are managed, how releases are produced, and how external contributions are handled.

These pages are written for maintainers and curious contributors who want to understand the *reasoning* behind a policy, not just the rule itself. Audience-facing documents that GitHub surfaces by convention — [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md), [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE) — remain the primary entry points for their respective audiences. The pages here cross-reference those files; they don't duplicate them.

## Audience map

| If you are… | Read… |
| --- | --- |
| A would-be contributor | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Reporting a vulnerability | [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) |
| A current or prospective maintainer | [Governance](./governance.md) |
| Curious about supply-chain hygiene | [Supply chain](./supply-chain.md) |
| Wondering how PR CI is structured for cost | [PR CI pipeline](./ci-pipeline.md) |
| Reasoning about the version contract (consumer or extension author) | [Versioning](./versioning.md) |
| Cutting a release (or auditing how) | [Versioning](./versioning.md) |
