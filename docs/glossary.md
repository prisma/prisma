# Glossary

User-facing terminology for Prisma Next. This is the **source of truth** for how we name things in documentation, CLI output, error messages, and public APIs.

Where internal terminology currently diverges from the desired user-facing term, the divergence is noted with a refactoring status.

---

## Core Concepts

### Contract

A verifiable agreement between an application and its database. Users author their contract in PSL (Prisma Schema Language) or TypeScript builders — describing models, fields, relations, and how they map to storage. The system compiles this into `contract.json` + `contract.d.ts`, which downstream tools (ORM, runtime, migrations) consume. The authored contract definition is the user's source of truth; `contract.json` is a derived build artifact in the same sense as `package-lock.json`.

The application carries its contract and the database is signed with the contract's hash, making the agreement verifiable at both migration and runtime.

### Schema

The structure of the database itself — tables, columns, indexes, constraints (SQL) or collections and indexes (MongoDB). The schema lives in the database; the contract lives in source code. Prisma Next manages the schema through migrations that bring the database in line with the contract.

In other ORMs, "schema" often refers to the user-authored model definitions. In Prisma Next, that's the contract. "Schema" refers specifically to the database's actual structure.

### Contract Provider

The part of your config that tells Prisma Next where your contract source lives and what format it's in. Prisma Next ships two built-in providers:

| Provider               | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `prismaContract()`     | Reads a `.prisma` PSL file               |
| `typescriptContract()` | Accepts a TypeScript-defined contract    |

Configured via the `contract:` property in `prisma.config.ts`.

### Extension

An installable package that adds features to Prisma Next — new data types, database-specific operations, or custom behavior. For example, the pgvector extension adds vector search support. Extensions integrate across the full stack: they can extend the contract language, contribute types and capabilities, and provide runtime behavior.

Configured via the `extensions` array in `prisma.config.ts`; emitted into the contract under the top-level `extensions` key. Concept-level type names (`ExtensionPackRef`, `ControlExtensionDescriptor`) keep the "pack" vocabulary.

### Middleware

A function that runs around every query, similar to middleware in Express or Koa. Middleware can inspect queries, enforce limits, collect metrics, or block unsafe operations — without changing how queries are built or executed. Examples: `budgets()` (cost limits), `lints()` (query checks).

At the framework level, middleware is defined by the `RuntimeMiddleware` interface in `@internal/framework-components`. A middleware can be family-agnostic (runs in any runtime) or scoped to a specific family (`familyId: 'sql'`) and/or target (`targetId: 'postgres'`). Family-specific interfaces (`SqlMiddleware`, `MongoMiddleware`) narrow the plan and context types.

### Plan

The compiled form of a query. Before anything touches the database, Prisma Next compiles your query into a plan — the query payload, parameters, and metadata. Plans are inspectable, so you (or your tooling) can see exactly what will execute. Guardrails like budgets and lints operate on plans, not raw queries. Each family has its own plan type — `SqlQueryPlan` carries a SQL string and parameters; `MongoQueryPlan` carries a command (find, insert, update, delete, or aggregate pipeline).

### Adapter

The piece that connects Prisma Next to a specific database. For SQL targets, the adapter translates queries into the correct dialect. For MongoDB, the adapter dispatches commands to the `mongodb` Node.js driver. Adapters also report what features the database supports, so Prisma Next can check at startup whether your contract's requirements are met.

### Driver

The library that handles the actual network connection to your database. A driver manages connections, transactions, and wire-protocol details for a specific database client (e.g., `pg` for Postgres, `mongodb` for MongoDB). Most users configure a driver once and don't interact with it directly.

### Target

Which specific database you're using — Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, etc. Each target belongs to a family (e.g., Postgres is a SQL target; MongoDB is a Mongo target) and supports a specific set of capabilities.

### Family

A category of databases that share fundamental characteristics. SQL is a family — Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite are all SQL targets that share concepts like tables, columns, and joins. MongoDB is its own family (not a target under a generic "document" family). Prisma Next defines shared behavior at the family level so individual targets only need to handle what's specific to them.

### Framework Component

The umbrella term for the five kinds of building blocks that make up a Prisma Next configuration: **family**, **target**, **adapter**, **driver**, and **extension**. Each framework component follows the same structural pattern: a `ComponentDescriptor` (declarative metadata — identity, version, capabilities, type imports) plus plane-specific descriptor and instance types (see [Descriptor](#descriptor), [Instance](#instance) in the Architecture section).

Framework components are composed into stacks via `create*Stack()` functions. The framework-components package (`@internal/framework-components`) owns the base types and assembly logic that operate on framework components generically, without knowing which family or target they belong to.

### Contract IR

The in-memory intermediate representation of a contract, produced by authoring (PSL parsing or TypeScript builders) and consumed by the emitter. Contract IR contains models, fields, relations, storage mappings, and metadata — everything needed to generate the emitted artifacts. It is not the same as `contract.json`: the IR may include transient state (e.g., authoring metadata) that is stripped during emission, and `contract.json` includes derived fields (e.g., hashes) that are computed during emission.

### Emission

The process of generating `contract.json` and `contract.d.ts` from a Contract IR. The emitter validates the IR, computes hashes, resolves type imports from the control stack, and writes the two output files. Emission is a control-plane concern — it runs at build time, not at runtime. The control plane orchestrates emission through `ControlFamilyInstance.emitContract()`.

---

## Domain Modeling

### Aggregate Root

A model that owns its own storage unit (table or collection) and serves as an ORM entry point. In the contract, aggregate roots are declared in the `roots` section, which maps ORM accessor names to model names (e.g., `"users": "User"` produces `db.users`). Models not in `roots` are only reachable through a parent — either via an embedded relation or as a polymorphic variant.

### Model (Entity)

A data description with unique identity and a lifecycle. Models appear in the contract's `models` section. Each model has one canonical storage location — either its own table/collection (aggregate root) or inside another model's storage (embedded). The distinction from value objects is identity: two Posts with the same title are still different Posts.

### Value Object

An object defined entirely by its field values, with no separate identity. Two instances with the same values are interchangeable — an Address with the same street/city/state is the same Address regardless of which User it belongs to. This is the key distinction from models (entities), which have identity independent of their fields.

Value objects are a future concept in the contract; currently they're represented as models with empty storage. A dedicated contract section would make the distinction explicit.

> **Status:** Not yet implemented in the contract. Tracked as an open question.

### Owner

A domain-level property on a model declaring aggregate membership. If Address says `"owner": "User"`, it means Address is a component of User's aggregate — its data is co-located within User's storage (embedded document in MongoDB, JSONB column in SQL). Owned models don't appear in `roots` and have no independent storage unit (they may still include `storage.relations` for nested owned children). The parent's `storage.relations` maps the relation to its physical location. See [ADR 177](architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20177%20-%20Ownership%20replaces%20relation%20strategy.md).

### Relation

A connection between two models in the contract. Relations are plain graph edges: they declare `to` (target model), `cardinality` (`1:N`, `N:1`), and optionally `on` (join details for referenced relations). Relations carry no storage annotations — whether the target model is co-located or independent is determined by whether it has an `owner` property.

### Discriminator

The field on a base model that distinguishes between variant shapes in a polymorphic model. The contract records the field name and the possible values: e.g., `"discriminator": { "field": "type" }` with variants mapping to values like `"bug"`, `"feature"`.

### Variant

A specialized model distinguished by a discriminator value. Variants appear as sibling models in the contract's `models` section, each with a `base` property pointing back to the base model. Variants carry only their type-specific fields; shared fields live on the base.

### Base (Model)

The model that a variant specializes. Chosen over "parent" or "superclass" to describe a structural relationship without implying OOP inheritance semantics. The contract says "Bug's base is Task" — a domain fact about the data, not a statement about class hierarchies.

### Specialization / Generalization

The terminology used instead of "inheritance" or "subclassing" for polymorphic models. A variant *specializes* a base model (adds type-specific fields). A base model *generalizes* its variants (captures shared structure). This framing describes data relationships without OOP baggage.

---

## Query Surfaces

### Query Builder

A type-safe interface for constructing queries that compile to plans. Each query builder is subject to the **one-query-one-statement rule**: a single builder call produces exactly one SQL statement. Prisma Next provides several query builders:

- **SQL query builder** — composable, relational query construction via chained method calls (`sql().from(...).select(...).limit(...)`)
- **Raw SQL query builder** — write SQL directly when the DSL doesn't cover your use case. Raw SQL queries still go through the same guardrails (budgets, lints, telemetry) as builder queries.

> **Divergence:** Currently named "query lane" / "lane" in code and architecture docs. The desired user-facing term is "query builder". **Status: pending refactor.**

### ORM Client

A higher-level query interface that coordinates multiple queries on your behalf. Unlike query builders, the ORM client is **not** bound by the one-query-one-statement rule — operations like `findMany` with `include` may issue several queries behind the scenes to load related data. Provides `findMany`, `create`, `update`, `delete` and relation loading (`include`, `select`).

### Collection

The primary ORM abstraction for querying a model. Each aggregate root gets a `Collection` instance (e.g., `db.users` is a `Collection<Contract, 'User'>`). Collections use immutable fluent chaining — each method call (`.where()`, `.include()`, `.take()`) returns a new Collection with accumulated state. Nothing executes until a terminal method (`.all()`, `.first()`) compiles the state into a family-specific query plan. The Collection interface is shared across families; only the terminal compilation differs. See [ADR 175](architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20175%20-%20Shared%20ORM%20Collection%20interface.md).

## Architecture

### Plane

One of three isolation zones that split the system by lifecycle phase. Each plane has its own packages, types, and import boundaries — code in one plane must not import executable code from another plane.

| Plane | Phase | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| **Control plane** | Build / migration time | Authoring contracts, emitting artifacts, planning and running migrations, verifying database state |
| **Execution plane** | Runtime | Validating contracts, building and executing query plans, ORM, middleware |
| **Shared plane** | Both | Type-only code and validators safe for either plane (contract IR types, codec types, operation types) |

The control plane produces artifacts (contract JSON, `.d.ts`, migrations); the execution plane consumes them. Both planes share types from the shared plane but never import across the control/execution boundary.

### Descriptor

A declarative, immutable object that describes *what* something is and *what it provides*, without carrying mutable state. Descriptors are configuration inputs — they declare identity, capabilities, and contributions so that the framework can compose them without executing anything.

The pattern is used throughout Prisma Next, not only for [framework components](#framework-component). For example, codec descriptors declare type mappings and encoding/decoding behavior. The most prominent use is in framework components, where each component kind has a base descriptor (`FamilyDescriptor`, `TargetDescriptor`, `AdapterDescriptor`, `DriverDescriptor`, `ExtensionDescriptor`) plus plane-specific extensions (`ControlFamilyDescriptor`, `RuntimeTargetDescriptor`, etc.) that add factory methods for creating instances.

Descriptors are typically exported as singleton const values (e.g., `mongoFamilyDescriptor`, `postgresTargetDescriptor`).

### Instance

A runtime object created from a descriptor via a factory method (typically `create()` on the descriptor). Instances carry state and behavior specific to one plane — a `ControlFamilyInstance` knows how to emit contracts and run migrations; a `RuntimeAdapterInstance` knows how to encode/decode values and lower queries to a target dialect.

Instances are created during stack assembly or instantiation, not imported directly.

### Stack

A composition of [framework components](#framework-component) for a given plane. A stack carries pre-computed aggregations of the contributions from all its components (type imports, renderers, capabilities, authoring contributions, etc.), so downstream code can consume the combined result without knowing which component contributed what.

Each plane has its own stack type:

| Stack | Plane | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `ControlStack` | Control | The component descriptors and their aggregated contributions (type imports, renderers, extension IDs, authoring contributions) needed for contract emission and migration |
| `ExecutionStack` | Execution | Runtime descriptors (target, adapter, driver, extensions), ready for instantiation |

> Use `createControlStack()` from `@internal/framework-components/control` to build a `ControlStack`.

## Infrastructure

### Capability

A specific feature that a database may or may not support (e.g., `RETURNING` clauses, vector indexes). Your contract declares which capabilities it needs; the adapter reports which ones the database provides. Prisma Next checks these match at startup, so you find out about missing features immediately rather than at query time.

### Codec

Handles the translation between JavaScript values and database values. When you read a timestamp from the database, a codec converts it to a JavaScript `Date`; when you write it back, the codec converts it the other way. Extensions provide codecs for specialized types like vectors or geometries.

### Marker

A small record stored in the database that tracks which contract the database is currently migrated to. Before running queries or migrations, Prisma Next checks that the marker matches the contract the application is carrying. This catches situations where the database and application have drifted out of sync — for example, if a migration was run but the application wasn't redeployed.

### Namespace

A unique name that identifies an extension. Namespaces keep extensions from colliding with each other and with built-in features. You'll see them in PSL constructor expressions (`pgvector.Vector(...)`), in the contract (`extensions.pgvector`), and in capability names (`pgvector.ivfflat`).

### Naming Mode

Where a database object's name comes from. An object is **wire-named** when Prisma Next derives the name (see [wire name](#wire-name)), or **exact-named** when you supply the name and Prisma Next adopts it verbatim — `map:` on an index, `@@map` on an RLS policy block. The two modes differ in how drift is detected: a wire name commits to the object's content, so comparing names is comparing content; an exact name says nothing about content, so the body is compared byte-for-byte against the database's own reprint.

Naming mode is independent of [control policy](architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20224%20-%20Control%20Policy%20—%20framework-locked%20vocabulary%20and%20family-owned%20dispatch.md), which answers a different question: whether Prisma Next may write to the object at all.

### Wire Name

The name Prisma Next derives for an object it names itself: your prefix, an underscore, and eight hex characters of a hash over the object's content — `user_email_idx_46df9cad`. Because the suffix is content-addressed, an unchanged definition always produces the same name, and a name match is a content match. Renaming the prefix while leaving the definition alone keeps the suffix, which is how a rename is recognized as a rename rather than a drop and a create. See [ADR 234](architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20234%20-%20Content-addressed%20wire%20names%20for%20Postgres-normalized%20objects.md).

## Migration & Database Lifecycle

Vocabulary that describes how databases move between contracts. The mental-model anchor is **Git**: contracts are like commits, migrations are like patches between them, refs are like branches, and `migrate --to <contract>` is like `git checkout`.

### Migration (noun)

A unit of intent that takes the database from one **contract** to another. On disk, a migration is a directory under `migrations/<space>/` containing `migration.json` (the manifest with `from`/`to` hashes and a content-addressed `migrationHash`), `ops.json` (the operations to execute), and `migration.ts` (the editable authoring surface). Its bookend contracts resolve by hash through the shared content-addressed store at `migrations/snapshots/<hex>/contract.json` — the migration directory itself carries no contract copy.

`migration` is **always a noun** — never a verb. The act of advancing a database is `migrate` (see below).

### Migrate (verb)

The act of advancing a *live database instance* along the migration graph. The canonical command is `prisma-next migrate [--to <contract>]`: walks from the database marker's current contract to the named target contract, executing each migration on the live database. `migrate` is forward-only — it never reverses, never rewinds, never resets.

### Migration Graph

The directed graph of contracts (nodes) connected by migrations (edges). Built by reading every `migration.json` under `migrations/<space>/`. The graph supports path-finding (shortest path from `from` to `to`), divergence detection (multiple reachable leaves), and integrity checks.

### Ref (Contract Ref)

A named pointer at a contract, stored as `migrations/<space>/refs/<name>.json` (`{hash, invariants}`); the contract it names resolves through the shared content-addressed store at `migrations/snapshots/<hex>/contract.json` by that hash. Refs are environment-named (`production`, `staging`) and describe *where CD will `migrate --to` next* in that environment. The default `db` ref records dev-database checkpoint state for offline planning. Managed via `prisma-next ref set|list|delete`. See [ADR 218 — Refs with paired contract snapshots](architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20218%20-%20Refs%20with%20paired%20contract%20snapshots%20and%20universal%20graph-node%20invariant.md) (paired-snapshot part superseded — see its Status note) and [ADR 240 — Contract snapshots live in a content-addressed store](architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20240%20-%20Contract%20snapshots%20live%20in%20a%20content-addressed%20store.md).

A ref is a specific kind of [contract reference](#contract-reference) — the named, file-backed, persistent kind.

### Ledger

An append-only audit log of executed migrations, per database. The ledger records what migration ran when. The framework reads the [marker](#marker) (not the ledger) for routing decisions; the ledger is for visualization and auditing.

### Drift

Divergence between contract and database. Taxonomy includes marker-level (missing, corrupt, stale, hash mismatch), schema-level (manual DDL, partial execution, concurrent execution), graph-level (orphan database, no path, path breakage, cycle), capability (missing, downgrade, profile mismatch), transactional, cache/replica freshness, and canonicalization drift.

### Storage Hash

The deterministic hash over a contract's storage-affecting parts (`schemaVersion`, `targetFamily`, `target`, `storage`). The identity of a *contract* in the migration graph; when the CLI says "hash" without qualification, this is what it means. Formerly `coreHash`.

### Migration Hash

The content-addressed hash over a migration's `(strippedManifest, ops)`. The identity of a migration as a *physical effect on storage*, independent of cosmetic contract details. Always qualified as "migration hash" in user-facing prose — bare "hash" means the storage hash.

### Contract Reference

The argument grammar for "name a contract" across every flag and positional that accepts one (`migrate --to`, `db update --to`, `db sign [<contract>]`, `migration plan --from`, `migration status --to/--from`, `ref set`'s second argument). All forms resolve to a contract storage hash:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<hash>` or `<hash-prefix>` | Bare hex (6+ chars), matched against contract storage hashes |
| `<ref-name>` | The contract the named ref points at |
| `<migration-dir-name>` | The migration's `to`-contract |
| `<migration-dir-name>^` | The migration's `from`-contract |
| `<filesystem-path>` | The contract file at that path (prefixed with `./`) |

Ambiguity within a namespace (two hashes sharing a short prefix; a hex-named directory colliding with a hash prefix) produces an explicit error with candidate listing — the same rule Git uses for short SHAs.

### Migration Reference

The argument grammar for "name a migration" (used by `migration show <m>`, `migration check <m>`). All forms resolve to a migration package:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<hash>` or `<hash-prefix>` | Bare hex, matched against migration hashes |
| `<migration-dir-name>` | The migration directly |

The CLI distinguishes contract-grammar input where a migration is expected (or vice versa) with a "wrong grammar" diagnostic naming the right verb-grammar pair.

### `db verify`

A read-only live-database operation that verifies the database satisfies the contract. Shape: `db verify [--schema-only|--marker-only|--strict]`. Returns ok / not-ok with a structured envelope. Does not mutate.

### `migration check`

A read-only filesystem operation that verifies on-disk migration packages are internally consistent and the graph is well-formed. Shape: `migration check [<m>]` — per-migration with the argument; graph-wide without. Exit codes: `0` (OK), `2` (PRECONDITION — bad argument or unknown migration), `4` (INTEGRITY_FAILED — one or more checks failed). Fine-grained discrimination uses PN codes:

| PN code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-001 HASH_MISMATCH` | Recomputed migration hash disagrees with stored value |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-002 MANIFEST_INCOMPLETE` | `migration.json` or `ops.json` missing on disk |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-003 ORPHAN_MIGRATION` | Migration has no graph-connecting predecessor |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-004 DANGLING_REF` | Ref points at a contract hash absent from the graph |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-005 EDGE_MISMATCH` | Migration's `metadata.to` disagrees with its snapshot store entry's `storageHash` |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-006 SNAPSHOT_UNREADABLE` | Migration's snapshot store entry exists but cannot be parsed |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-007 SELF_EDGE` | Migration's source equals its target (`from === to`) with no data invariant — a true no-op self-edge |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-008 ORPHAN_SPACE_DIR` | A contract-space directory exists on disk but no extension declares it |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-009 UNMATERIALISED_EXTENSION` | An extension is declared in `extensions` but has no on-disk migrations directory |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-010 HEAD_REF_MISSING` | A contract space is missing its `refs/head.json` head ref |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-011 HEAD_REF_NOT_IN_GRAPH` | A contract space's head ref points at a hash absent from its migration graph |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-012 REF_UNREADABLE` | A contract space's ref file is corrupt or unparseable |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-013 TARGET_MISMATCH` | A contract space targets a different database than the project |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-014 STORAGE_ELEMENT_CONFLICT` | A storage element is claimed by more than one contract space |
| `PN-MIG-CHECK-015 CONTRACT_UNREADABLE` | A contract space's on-disk contract cannot be read or deserialized |

Codes `001`/`002` are reported per package across every contract space (the app space plus extensions); `007`–`015` are aggregate, cross-space checks (self-edge plus layout / head-ref / contract / disjointness drift) that run in the graph-wide form. Does not consult the database.
