# Testing

- Core guide: `docs/Testing Guide.md`
- Language: `.cursor/rules/omit-should-in-tests.mdc`
- Patterns: `.cursor/rules/vitest-expect-typeof.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/test-file-organization.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/test-import-patterns.mdc`

## Test Commands

```bash
pnpm test:packages      # Unit tests for packages only
pnpm test:integration   # Integration tests (pretest builds first)
pnpm test:e2e           # End-to-end tests
pnpm test:all           # All tests (packages + examples + integration + e2e)
pnpm coverage:packages  # Build package prerequisites, then run package coverage once at the root
pnpm coverage:report    # Report package policy results from the existing root coverage output
```

Package coverage policies live in `coverage.config.json` beside each package's `vitest.config.ts`. The root run executes all package Vitest projects in one process. Each entry in `coverage/coverage-final.json` is attributed to the package that owns the entry's source path. Examples are tested separately with `pnpm test:examples` and do not contribute to package coverage. Root warning-only entries relax thresholds only; Vitest assertion failures always block.

> Integration tests (`test/integration`) run against each package's built `dist`, not its source. After changing a package's source, rebuild it (e.g. `pnpm --filter <pkg> build`) before running a bare `vitest` filter, or the test will exercise stale output. The full `pnpm test:integration` pretest builds automatically, so this only bites targeted runs.

## CI

CI runs on pull requests via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

- **typecheck** + **lint**: Run in parallel, no dependencies
- **build**: Compiles all packages
- **test** (`Test & Coverage`): Runs package tests once through the root coverage process, reports package threshold policy even after a failed coverage run, then tests examples once; requires Postgres
- **test-e2e**: Runs after build and requires Postgres

Environment: Node 24.16.0, pnpm 10, Postgres 15. `TEST_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=2` in CI.
