/**
 * Cafes whose spherical distance to `point` is at most `metres`.
 *
 * `ST_DistanceSphere` works on `geometry` (not just `geography`) and
 * returns metres on a sphere — the right tool for "within N metres of"
 * queries on lat/lng data without converting columns to geography.
 *
 * Ordering nearest-first with `id ASC` as a tie-breaker makes the
 * `.take(limit)` slice the deterministic nearest-N rather than an
 * arbitrary subset when more cafes match the radius than `limit`.
 *
 * SQL: WHERE ST_DistanceSphere(location, $point) <= $metres
 *      ORDER BY ST_DistanceSphere(location, $point) ASC, id ASC
 *      LIMIT $limit
