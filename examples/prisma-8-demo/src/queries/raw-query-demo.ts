 * Whole-query raw SQL — the statement-position counterpart to `fns.raw`

 * query).
 *
 * `db.raw.sql` is the same tagged template, terminated differently:
 *
 * - `.returnsRow(spec)` declares the result columns and yields a plan the
 *   runtime's `query()` streams decoded rows from.
 * - `.affectedCount()` declares no columns and yields a plan the runtime's
 *   `execute()` reports statistics for.
 *
 * A row spec entry is either a contract column (`user.columns.email` — codec,
 * nullability, and TypeScript type all inherited) or an explicit codec id for
 * a column the contract doesn't have, like a `count(*)`. Interpolated values
 * become bound parameters; nothing is spliced into the SQL text.

 * codec directly and reads back as a `bigint`.
