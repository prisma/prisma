 * Bug triage view: each user with only their `Bug` tasks of a given severity.
 *
 * `.variant('Bug')` narrows the polymorphic include to a single variant, so the
 * included rows are `Bug`-shaped and the refinement's `where` can filter on the
 * variant's own column (`severity`, which lives in the joined `bug` table). The
 * include takes the default projection, so each row comes back in its full
 * `Bug` shape — the shared `Task` columns plus the `Bug` columns.
