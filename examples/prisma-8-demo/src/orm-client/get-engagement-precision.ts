 * back a rounded value, and `countBigInt`, `sumBigInt` and `avgDecimal` are the
 * exact answers to reach for.
 *
 * The seeded impressions make that concrete: no single row is anywhere near the
 * safe-integer range, but their total is 2^53 + 1000, so `sum('impressionCount')`
 * raises and `sumBigInt('impressionCount')` answers exactly. The guard is about
 * the value the aggregate produces, not the values it read.
 *
 * Each call is issued separately so one aggregate's guard cannot hide another
 * aggregate's answer.
