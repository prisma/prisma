# Observability & lifecycle

[← Feature-support matrix index](../scorecard.md)

Legend:

- `✅` **Works** — proven by a Prisma Next **integration** test (one that executes the feature against a database — Postgres via PGlite, SQLite via its real driver, or MongoDB via mongodb-memory-server — and asserts the observable runtime result). Unit-tier tests (SQL/AST/plan/type/snapshot assertions, or any test that never hits a database) do not qualify. Per-database rigor applies: a Postgres integration test cannot justify a SQLite or MongoDB `✅`, and vice versa.
- `🟡` **Untested** — reachable through the Prisma Next public surface, but no proving Prisma Next integration test exists yet (evidence left blank). This includes features whose only backing is a unit-tier test.
- `🧪` **Experimental** — shipped in Prisma Next but outside the stability promise (polymorphism / multi-table inheritance).
- `❌` **Not in 8.0** — deliberately absent from Prisma Next.
- `—` **n/a** — feature does not apply to that database.
