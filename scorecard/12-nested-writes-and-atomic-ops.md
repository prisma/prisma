# Nested writes & atomic ops

[← Feature-support matrix index](../scorecard.md)

Legend:

- `✅` **Works** — proven by a Prisma Next **integration** test (one that executes the feature against a database — Postgres via PGlite, SQLite via its real driver, or MongoDB via mongodb-memory-server — and asserts the observable runtime result). Unit-tier tests (SQL/AST/plan/type/snapshot assertions, or any test that never hits a database) do not qualify. Per-database rigor applies: a Postgres integration test cannot justify a SQLite or MongoDB `✅`, and vice versa.
- `🟡` **Untested** — reachable through the Prisma Next public surface, but no proving Prisma Next integration test exists yet (evidence left blank). This includes features whose only backing is a unit-tier test.
- `🧪` **Experimental** — shipped in Prisma Next but outside the stability promise (polymorphism / multi-table inheritance).
- `❌` **Not in 8.0** — deliberately absent from Prisma Next.
- `—` **n/a** — feature does not apply to that database.

| Feature | Postgres | SQLite | MongoDB | Prisma Next evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nested `create` on relations | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/nested-mutations.test.ts` (`nested create() on to-many relations`) |
| Nested `connect` | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/nested-mutations.test.ts` (`nested connect() on to-one relations`) |
| Nested `disconnect` (with criteria) | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/nested-mutations.test.ts` (`disconnect() with criteria`) |
| Deep nested writes (3+ levels) | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/nested-mutations.test.ts` (`deep nested create() across three levels`) |
| Many-to-many `connect` | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/mn-nested-write.test.ts` (`create(): connect links an existing tag via junction`) |
| Many-to-many `disconnect` | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/mn-nested-write.test.ts` (`update(): disconnect removes the junction link`) |
| Many-to-many nested `create` | ✅ | 🟡 | — | `test/integration/test/sql-orm-client/mn-nested-write.test.ts` (`create(): nested create inserts the Tag row and the junction link`) |
