/**
 * Computes a stable content hash for a lowered Mongo execution plan.
 *
 * Internally builds an unambiguous canonical-stringified preimage from
 * two components:
 *
 * 1. `meta.storageHash` — discriminates by schema. A migration changes the
 *    storage hash, which invalidates cached entries automatically (no
 *    per-app invalidation logic needed for schema changes).
 * 2. `exec.command` — the wire command. `canonicalStringify` produces a
 *    deterministic serialization that is stable across object key
 *    insertion order and that distinguishes types JSON would otherwise
 *    conflate (e.g. `BigInt(1)` vs `1`, `Date` vs ISO string, `Buffer`
 *    vs number array). The spread converts the frozen wire-command
 *    class instance (`InsertOneWireCommand`, `AggregateWireCommand`, …)
 *    into a plain object exposing its own enumerable properties
 *    (`kind`, `collection`, plus the payload-specific fields like
 *    `document`/`filter`/`update`/`pipeline`/…), which is what
 *    `canonicalStringify` accepts; class instances are rejected
 *    outright to prevent silent collisions.
 *
 * Unlike SQL, there is no separate "rendered statement" component because
 * a Mongo `MongoExecutionPlan.command` is the wire command itself —
 * canonicalizing it captures both structure and parameters in one pass.
 *
 * The components are wrapped in an object and canonicalized as a single
 * unit (rather than concatenated with a delimiter) so component
 * boundaries are unambiguous and cannot collide with a different split
 * of the same characters.
 *
 * The canonical string is then piped through `hashContent` to produce a
 * bounded, opaque digest. See `@internal/utils/hash-content` for the
 * rationale.
 *
 * @throws {RuntimeErrorEnvelope} {@link RUNTIME_CONTENT_HASH_REQUIRES_RESOLVED_COMMAND}
 * when `exec.command` is still a pre-resolve draft (plain object), e.g. when
 * `contentHash` is called from `beforeExecute`.
