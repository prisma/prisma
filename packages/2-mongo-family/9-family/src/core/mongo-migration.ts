/**
 * Family-owned base class for Mongo migrations.
 *
 * Provides the fixed `targetId = 'mongo'` so that user-authored migrations
 * and renderer-generated scaffolds (e.g. the output of
 * `renderCallsToTypeScript`) inherit it directly and don't have to re-declare
 * the abstract `targetId` member from `Migration`.
 *
 * The operation type parameter is `AnyMongoMigrationOperation` — the union
 * of DDL-shaped `MongoMigrationPlanOperation` and `MongoDataTransformOperation` —
 * so subclasses can return a mix of schema operations (e.g. `createIndex`,
 * `setValidation`) and data-transform operations (e.g. `dataTransform`).
 * Mirrors the generic parameter used by `PlannerProducedMongoMigration`.
 *
 * Binds the framework base's `Start` / `End` contract generics so a subclass
 * that assigns its snapshot-store `contract.json` imports to
 * `startContractJson` / `endContractJson` gets fully-typed view accessors:
 * `this.endContract` is a `MongoContractView<End>`
 * (and `this.startContract` a `MongoContractView<Start> | null`), built lazily
 * from those JSON fields via the shared `MigrationContractViews` helper. The
 * framework base derives `describe()` from the same JSON. View getters live on
 * the family base (not the framework base) because `MongoContractView`'s shape
 * is Mongo-specific.
