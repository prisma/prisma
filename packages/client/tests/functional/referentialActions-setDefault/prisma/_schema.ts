// Note: We can't test `SetDefault` with automatically created ids in SQLServer.
// Had we defined Prisma models with automatic ids in the form of `id Int @id @default(autoincrement())`,
// SQL Server would have thrown a runtime error at the `CREATE TABLE` level, as Prisma would use the IDENTITY(1, 1) type
// for the id column, which cannot be created or updated explicitly.
// The escape hatch would be using `SET IDENTITY_INSERT OFF`, which is however allowed only for a single table per session,
// and isn't supported by Prisma (not even in raw mode, see https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/15305)
//
// The obvious solution for us was to avoid `@default(autoincrement())` in tests.
// Providing a separate `id` schema definition for each provider is not necessary.
