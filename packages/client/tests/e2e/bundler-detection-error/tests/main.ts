Invalid \`prisma.user.create()\` invocation:


Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "debian-openssl-3.0.x".

This is likely caused by a bundler that has not copied "libquery_engine-debian-openssl-3.0.x.so.node" next to the resulting bundle.
Ensure that "libquery_engine-debian-openssl-3.0.x.so.node" has been copied next to the bundle or in "generated/client".

We would appreciate if you could take the time to share some information with us.
