 * aggregate as an ownership oracle so it can ask, per extra, whether any
 * space owns it — a sibling-owned table is left untouched, so the planner

 * (the aggregate's ambient target). The family's planner does not
 * stamp `targetId` on the produced plan; the aggregate planner is
 * the single point that knows the target.
 *
 * Used by:
 *
 * - The app space by default (CLI policy

 * - Any extension space whose `headRef.invariants` is empty and whose
 *   graph is non-empty (the all-external, zero-migration-package case is
 *   handled directly by the aggregate planner without calling this).
