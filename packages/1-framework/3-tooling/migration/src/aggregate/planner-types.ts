 *   regardless of whether a graph is available. The CLI's daily-driver

 *   to keep today's app-space behaviour: the user's authored
 *   `migrations/` directory is **not** walked for the app space, the
 *   plan is fabricated on the fly. Extension spaces are walked.
 *
 *   Listing a contract space here whose `headRef.invariants` is non-empty is
 *   a `policyConflict` — a diff-fabricated plan cannot satisfy authored
