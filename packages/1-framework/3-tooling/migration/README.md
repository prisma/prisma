# @internal/migration-tools

> **Internal package.** This package is an implementation detail of Prisma Next and is published only to support its runtime. Its API is unstable and may change without notice. Do not depend on this package directly; install `@prisma/cli` and a database facade (e.g. `@prisma/orm-postgres`) instead.

On-disk migration persistence, hash verification, and history reconstruction for Prisma Next.

## Responsibilities

- **Types**: Define the migration package shape (`MigrationMetadata`, `MigrationOps`, `MigrationPackage`, `MigrationGraph`)
- **I/O**: Read and write migration packages to/from disk (`migration.json` + `ops.json`)
- **Hashing**: Compute and verify content-addressed migration hashes for tamper detection
- **History reconstruction**: Reconstruct and navigate migration history (path finding, latest migration detection, cycle/orphan detection)

## Hash framing

`computeMigrationHash` in `hash.ts` uses explicit framing:

1. Strip the non-identity field (`migrationHash`) from
   the metadata envelope, then canonicalize the stripped envelope and the
   ops array.
2. SHA-256 each canonical part independently.
3. SHA-256 the canonical JSON tuple `[hash(metadata), hash(ops)]`.

This avoids delimiter-ambiguity and pins `migrationHash` to a 2-tuple over
the on-disk storage shape. Per [ADR 199 — Storage-only migration identity],
contracts are anchored by the storage-hash bookends (`from`, `to`) inside
the metadata envelope — the full contract IRs themselves are not part of
the manifest.

[ADR 199 — Storage-only migration identity]: ../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20199%20-%20Storage-only%20migration%20identity.md

## Ops validation boundary

`readMigrationPackage` performs intentionally shallow `ops.json` validation in `io.ts`:

- validates envelope fields (`id`, `label`, `operationClass`)
- does not fully validate operation-specific payload shape

Full semantic validation happens in target/family migration planners and runners at execution/planning time.

## What `ops.json` does NOT contain

`ops.json` carries the **post-lowering execution form** of every operation. The runner is a dispatcher, not a compiler — it does not invoke the lowerer, the codec system, the contract validator, or any other build-time pipeline at apply time. See [ADR 192 — ops.json is the migration contract](../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20192%20-%20ops.json%20is%20the%20migration%20contract.md) §"No compilation at apply time".

Concretely, an `ops.json` file does not contain:

- **TypeScript** or any other source code. `migration.ts` is authoring sugar; apply never imports it.
- **Codec metadata** (`codec`, `codecId`, `typeParams`). Codecs are resolved during lowering; their wire-format outputs land in `params[]` (SQL) or as literals in the structured command (Mongo). See [ADR 212 — AST-bound codec resolution](../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20212%20-%20AST-bound%20codec%20resolution.md).
- **Pre-lowering ASTs.** Every step is in the form the driver consumes — `(sql_template, params[])` for SQL, structured `kind`-discriminated commands for Mongo.
- **Contract references** that require resolution at apply time. The runner does not need the contract to execute steps (it reads it for marker/ledger bookkeeping, not for compilation).

Tampering and corruption are detected by `migrationId` (content-addressed hash of `migration.json` + `ops.json`; see [ADR 199](../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20199%20-%20Storage-only%20migration%20identity.md)). The "no apply-time compilation" invariant is what makes that hash meaningful: it pins what executes, not just what the author intended.

## On-Disk Format

Each migration is a directory containing two files:

```
migrations/
  20260225T1430_add_users/
    migration.json    # MigrationMetadata
    ops.json          # MigrationPlanOperation[]
```

See [ADR 028](../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20028%20-%20Migration%20Structure%20%26%20Operations.md) and [ADR 001](../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20001%20-%20Migrations%20as%20Edges.md) for design rationale.
