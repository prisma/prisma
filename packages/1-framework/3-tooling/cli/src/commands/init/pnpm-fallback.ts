/**
 * Recognised pnpm error signatures that justify a fallback to npm.
 *
 * These patterns indicate the published artifact itself is at fault
 * (a leaked `workspace:*` or `catalog:` specifier), not the user's
 * environment — pnpm is faithfully reporting "I cannot resolve this
 * registry version", and npm is willing to install it because npm
 * doesn't care about the protocol prefix when there's a fallback range.
 *
 * The predicate lives on its own so both shells' `init` share one list:
 * the commander command matches it against captured child stderr, the
 * engine command against the stderr the package-manager capability
 * returns on a failed install.
