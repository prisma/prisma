/**
 * `defineCommand` with the ORM's error boundary already attached. Every ORM command is defined
 * through this rather than through `defineCommand` directly.
 *
 * Without it, an error a handler throws reaches the engine, whose duck test accepts
 * prisma/prisma's `CliStructuredError` — both classes carry that name — and then settles it
 * through fields the engine's own class has and this one does not. The envelope that results is
 * off-protocol. Catching here means every handler settles through the single conversion instead.
 *
 * An `InternalError` is the one thing this boundary does not convert. Its own contract says never
 * to catch it outside the outermost boundary: it means an invariant broke, which is a bug in
 * Prisma Next rather than something the user did. Re-throwing lets the engine settle it as a bug
 * at exit 1, where converting it would report the same number as a bad connection string.

/**
 * Hands the handler a config whose paths are absolute. The engine's own
 * loader evaluates `prisma.config.ts` without touching the paths inside it, so
 * a command mounted in the unified host receives `contract.output` and
 * `migrations.dir` exactly as authored — usually relative — while this repo's
 * bin finalizes them in its loader. Anchoring here, on the section every ORM
 * command reads, makes both hosts hand handlers the same absolute paths.
 *
 * The anchor is the working directory: the engine discovers the config in the
 * working directory only, so that is the file's own directory. (A `--config`
 * pointing into another directory is not visible from a command context; a
 * relative path inside such a file resolves against the invocation directory,
 * which is also what the file's author sees the command run from.)
 * Finalization is idempotent — an already-absolute path resolves to itself —
 * so a config that arrived finalized passes through unchanged.
