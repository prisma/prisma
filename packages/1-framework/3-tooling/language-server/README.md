# @internal/language-server

> **Internal package.** This package is an implementation detail of Prisma 8 and is published only to support its runtime. Its API is unstable and may change without notice. Do not depend on this package directly; install `@prisma/cli` and a database facade (e.g. `@prisma/orm-postgres`) instead.

The Prisma 8 language server speaks the Language Server Protocol over stdio for PSL schema inputs declared in a project's `prisma.config.ts`. It is launched by the `prisma lsp` subcommand, so editor features come from the project's own Prisma 8 version and stay version-matched by construction.

The server only handles documents whose first non-whitespace content is a `// use prisma-next` line comment; all other documents belong to the legacy (Prisma ≤7) language server and are ignored per request from current document content. The check must stay byte-for-byte in sync with the legacy server's copy in `prisma/language-tools`.

## Responsibilities

- Serve diagnostics, whole-document formatting, folding ranges, semantic tokens, and completion for open configured PSL inputs carrying the directive.
