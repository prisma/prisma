 * draft state — a migration directory either exists with fully attested
 * metadata or it does not.
 *
 * When the planner cannot lower an operation because of an unfilled
 * `placeholder(...)` slot, the migration is still written with
 * `migrationHash` hashed over `ops: []`. Re-running self-emit after the
 * user fills the placeholder produces a *different* `migrationHash`
 * (committed to the real ops); this is intentional.
 *
 * The on-disk JSON shape in `migration.json` matches this type
 * field-for-field — `JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2)` is the canonical
 * writer output (defined in `@internal/migration-tools/io`).
 *
 * The manifest carries identity (`from`, `to`, `migrationHash`) but
 * not the full contract IRs themselves. The destination and predecessor
 * contracts resolve by hash through the shared content-addressed store
 * at `migrations/snapshots/<hex>/contract.json`. The runner depends only
 * on `migration.json` + `ops.json` per package (plus the project-root
 * head contract). See `docs/architecture docs/subsystems/7. Migration System.md`.
