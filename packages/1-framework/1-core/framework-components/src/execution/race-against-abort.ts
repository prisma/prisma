/**
 * Race a per-cell `Promise.all` (or any other in-flight work promise) against
 * the supplied abort signal so the runtime returns `RUNTIME.ABORTED` promptly
 * even when codec bodies ignore the signal. In-flight bodies that ignore the
 * signal are abandoned and run to completion in the background — the
 * cooperative-cancellation contract documented in ADR 204.
 *
 * Call sites still SHOULD pre-check `signal.aborted` and short-circuit with
 * a phase-tagged `RUNTIME.ABORTED` envelope before invoking this helper —
 * that path is the canonical "aborted at entry" surface and avoids
 * scheduling the work promise. As a defensive belt-and-braces, this helper
 * also handles the already-aborted case internally: `AbortSignal` does not
 * replay past abort events to listeners registered after the abort, so we
 * inspect `signal.aborted` synchronously and reject with the sentinel
 * before installing the listener. The rejection is still attributed to the
 * abort path via the sentinel-identity check.
 *
 * Distinguishing the rejection source is load-bearing for AC-ERR4
 * (`RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED` / `RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED` pass through unchanged).
 * The semantically equivalent `abortable(signal)` helper in
 * `@internal/utils` rejects with `signal.reason ?? new DOMException(...)`,
 * which is not stably distinguishable from a codec-thrown error by identity
 * alone (a fresh fallback DOMException is allocated per call). We instead
 * track abort attribution with a unique sentinel: only the `onAbort` listener
 * installed here ever rejects with the sentinel, so an `error === sentinel`
 * identity check after the race is unambiguous.
 *
 * Lives in `framework-components` (rather than the SQL family, where it
 * originated in m2) so every family runtime that needs cooperative
 * cancellation around a codec-dispatch `Promise.all` (SQL encode + decode
 * today, Mongo encode in m3) shares the same attribution logic.
