/**
 * Drives a single query execution of `runDriver()` through the middleware
 * lifecycle's `interceptQuery` + row-source + termination phases.
 *
 * Lifecycle, in order:
 *  1. For each middleware in registration order: `interceptQuery(exec, ctx)`.
 *     The first non-`undefined` result wins; subsequent middleware's
 *     `interceptQuery` does not fire. On a hit, the runtime emits a
 *     `middleware.interceptQuery` debug event naming the winning middleware,
 *     switches the row source to the intercepted rows, and proceeds with
 *     `source: 'middleware'`. On all-passthrough (every `interceptQuery`
 *     returns `undefined` or is omitted), `source: 'driver'` is used and the
 *     row source is `runDriver()`.
 *  2. Iterate the row source. On the driver path, for each row, for each
 *     middleware in registration order: `onRow(row, exec, ctx)`; then yield
 *     the row. On the intercepted hit path, `onRow` is skipped — intercepted
 *     rows did not originate from a driver row stream — but rows are still
 *     yielded to the consumer in order.
 *  3. On successful completion: for each middleware in registration order:
 *     `afterQuery(exec, { rowCount, latencyMs, completed: true, source },
 *     ctx)`.
 *  4. On any error thrown during steps 1–2: for each middleware in
 *     registration order: `afterQuery(exec, { rowCount, latencyMs,
 *     completed: false, source }, ctx)`. Errors thrown by `afterQuery`
 *     during the error path are swallowed so they do not mask the original
 *     error. The original error is then rethrown.
 *
 * `beforeQuery` is **not** fired here — see
 * {@link runBeforeQueryChain} in `before-execute-chain.ts`. Family runtimes
 * call that helper between the AST → plan lowering step and the parameter
 * encode step so middleware that mutates ParamRef values can have its
 * mutations visible to encode. `runQueryWithMiddleware` operates on the
 * fully-encoded plan; interceptors therefore observe a fully-mutated,
 * encoded plan.
 *
 * The `source` field on `AfterQueryResult` lets observers (telemetry, lints,
 * budgets) distinguish driver-served from middleware-served executions
 * without needing their own out-of-band signal.
 *
 * This helper is the single canonical implementation of the
 * intercept-and-row-source loop; family runtimes should not reimplement it.
