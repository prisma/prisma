 *
 * Annotations declare which kinds they apply to via `defineAnnotation`'s
 * `applicableTo` option; lane terminals enforce the constraint at both the
 * type level (via `ValidAnnotations`) and at runtime (via

 * are deliberately deferred. The binary covers the common case (the cache
 * middleware applies to reads; an audit annotation would apply to writes;
 * tracing/OTel applies to both). When a real annotation surfaces that needs
 * a finer split, the union widens and existing handles remain typecheckable.

/**

 *
 * - `namespace` — the namespace string the handle was declared with.
 * - `applicableTo` — the frozen `ReadonlySet<Kinds>` consumed by both
 *   the type-level `ValidAnnotations` gate and the runtime
 *   `assertAnnotationsApplicable` gate.
 * - `read(plan)` — extract the `Payload` from a plan's `meta.annotations`
 *   if a value was previously written under this handle's namespace.
 *   Returns `undefined` when the annotation is absent or when the stored
 *   value is not a branded `AnnotationValue` (e.g. framework-internal
 *   metadata under the same namespace key).
 *
 * Handles are the only supported public entry point for reading and
 * writing annotations. Direct mutation of `plan.meta.annotations` is not
 * part of the public API.

 * ```typescript
 * const cacheAnnotation = defineAnnotation<{ ttl: number }>()({

 * // Call the handle to construct a value:
 * const applied = cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60 });
 *
 * // Read a stored value off a plan:
 * const payload = cacheAnnotation.read(plan);
 * ```
 *
 * Note on the inherited `Function.prototype.apply`: because the handle is
 * a function, the property name `apply` resolves to JavaScript's built-in
 * `Function.prototype.apply` (which lets you invoke a function with an
 * array of arguments). This is **not** the construction entry point — to
 * build an `AnnotationValue`, call the handle directly. The
 * `AnnotationHandle` interface deliberately does not declare an `apply`
 * member of its own.

 * parameter, so the operation kinds appear exactly once at the call site.

 * // Read-only annotation. Lane terminals like `db.User.first(...)` accept

/**
 * Type-level applicability gate consumed by lane terminals.
 *
 * Maps a tuple of `AnnotationValue`s to a tuple where each element either
 * keeps its annotation type (when the annotation's declared `Kinds`
 * includes the terminal's operation kind `K`) or resolves to `never`
 * (when the kinds are incompatible). A `never` element makes the entire
 * tuple unassignable, surfacing the mismatch as a type error at the call
 * site of the terminal.
 *
 * The SQL DSL builders constrain their variadic `...annotations`
 * parameter via `As & ValidAnnotations<K, As>`. **The intersection is
 * load-bearing** — see the note below. The ORM terminals deliberately
 * sidestep this trick by taking one annotation per `meta.annotate(...)`
 * call (no variadic-tuple inference involved), so `ValidAnnotations` is
 * consumed only by the SQL DSL today.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class SelectQuery<Row> {
 *   annotate<As extends readonly AnnotationValue<unknown, OperationKind>[]>(
 *     ...annotations: As & ValidAnnotations<'read', As>
 *   ): SelectQuery<Row>;
 * }
 *
 * class InsertQuery<Row> {
 *   annotate<As extends readonly AnnotationValue<unknown, OperationKind>[]>(
 *     ...annotations: As & ValidAnnotations<'write', As>
 *   ): InsertQuery<Row>;
 * }
 *
 * db.users.select('id').annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60 }));
 * // ✓ cacheAnnotation declares 'read'; SelectQuery.annotate requires 'read'.
 *
 * db.users.insert([{ name: 'Alice' }]).annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60 }));
 * // ✗ cacheAnnotation declares 'read'; InsertQuery.annotate requires 'write'.
 * //   Element resolves to `never` → tuple unassignable → type error.
 * ```
 *
 * **Why `As & ValidAnnotations<K, As>` and not `ValidAnnotations<K, As>`
 * alone.** TypeScript's variadic-tuple inference is too forgiving when
 * the parameter type refers to `As` only through `ValidAnnotations`: it
 * will pick an `As` that makes the call valid even when the gated tuple
 * would contain `never` for an inapplicable element. The intersection
 * pins `As` to the actual call-site tuple AND requires it to be
 * assignable to the gated form. A `never` element in the gated tuple
 * then collapses the corresponding intersection position to `never`,
 * and the inapplicable argument fails to assign — surfacing the mismatch
 * as a type error at the call site.
 *
 * The runtime helper `assertAnnotationsApplicable` covers the equivalent
 * check at runtime so casts and `any` cannot bypass this gate.
