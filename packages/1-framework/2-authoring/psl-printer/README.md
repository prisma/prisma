# @internal/psl-printer

> **Internal package.** This package is an implementation detail of Prisma Next and is published only to support its runtime. Its API is unstable and may change without notice. Do not depend on this package directly; install `@prisma/cli` and a database facade (e.g. `@prisma/orm-postgres`) instead.

Prints Prisma Schema Language (PSL) from `PslDocumentAst` (`@internal/framework-components/psl-ast`).

## Overview

`@internal/psl-printer` renders deterministic PSL text from a `PslDocumentAst` (defined in `@internal/framework-components/psl-ast`). The package is target-agnostic: SQL → AST construction lives in the SQL family (`@internal/family-sql`'s `inferPslContract` capability).

## Responsibilities

- Convert structured AST (`model`, `field`, `enum`, `types`) into valid PSL output.
- Preserve `@map` / `@@map` and relation attributes from AST nodes.
- Generate deterministic output so snapshot-based tests remain stable.

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**
  - `@internal/framework-components`
- **Used by**
  - `@internal/cli` (consumes `printPsl(ast)` after the SQL family produces the AST)
  - `@internal/family-sql` (tests; consumes the printer to verify AST construction)
