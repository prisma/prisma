/**
 * Measures the PostgreSQL target's aggregate descriptors against the database
 * they describe.
 *
 * For every built-in codec and every built-in aggregate the suite asks two
 * questions of a live PostgreSQL: does this aggregate exist over this type at
 * all, and — when it does — what type does it return? Both answers are compared
 * against what the aggregate registry resolves, so a descriptor claiming a
 * result codec PostgreSQL does not produce fails here, and so does a pair the
 * descriptors leave unclaimed that PostgreSQL would in fact aggregate. What the
 * registry answers where no probe can settle it — which inputs a lossless
 * variant is offered over, which overload wins a tie — is the sibling
 * `aggregate-resolution.test.ts`, which needs no database.
 *
 * Result types are compared as `regtype`, which ignores type modifiers: what is
 * asserted is that `min` over a `numeric(10,3)` returns *a* numeric, not that it
 * returns one of the same precision.
 *
 * What each row runs is the expression its lowering builds, not a call named
 * after the operation: `countBigInt`, `sumBigInt`, and `avgDecimal` compute with
 * the SQL aggregate their bare namesakes use and differ in how the result is
 * read, and `avg` over an integer casts its result. So every probe here renders
 * the row's own lowering.
 *
 * Two rows declare a codec whose native type is not the type PostgreSQL
 * computes — `sum` over a 64-bit integer, whose `numeric` total the
 * number-flavoured codec reads and range-guards. They are named in
 * `READS_A_COMPUTED_TYPE`, which the matrix measures against.
 *
 * The pairs PostgreSQL refuses, and which therefore carry no descriptor:
 * `sum`/`avg` over every non-numeric, non-temporal type (including `money`,
 * which has a `sum` but no `avg`, and no codec of its own in this target); and
 * `min`/`max` over `bool`, `uuid`, `bytea`, `bit`, `bit varying`, `json`, and
 * `jsonb` — all of which advertise `equality` or `order` and would have been
 * swept up by a trait fallback inferred from traits rather than probed. That
 * measurement applies to the bare operations, whose SQL call is the operation's
 * own name; where a lossless variant is offered is policy, and is pinned as
 * such next door.
