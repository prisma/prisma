# @internal/postgres-codec-testkit

Database-backed conformance harness for PostgreSQL codec JSON projections.

## Purpose

A codec descriptor's `projectJson()` renders SQL that reproduces `codec.encodeJson()` inside the database. This package runs that claim against a live PostgreSQL: it stores a representative value, projects the stored column, executes the projection, and checks that the parsed result agrees with `encodeJson` and round-trips back through `decodeJson`.

It is dev-only tooling, not a runtime dependency — extension authors install it to verify their own codec descriptors the same way this package's own `test/` suite verifies every built-in PostgreSQL codec descriptor.

## Usage

```ts
import { runPostgresCodecProjection } from '@internal/postgres-codec-testkit';
import type { PostgresCodecConformanceCase } from '@internal/postgres-codec-testkit';

const conformanceCase: PostgresCodecConformanceCase = {
  codecId: 'my-extension/my-codec@1',
  // A codec an extension contributes rather than the target registering —
  // the built-in registry only knows the built-ins.
  descriptor: myCodecDescriptor,
  label: 'representative value',
  value: someApplicationValue,
};

const outcome = await runPostgresCodecProjection(connection, conformanceCase);
// outcome.failure is undefined when the projection conforms.
```

`connection` is any object satisfying `ConformanceConnection` — `{ query(sql, params?) }` — so the caller supplies whichever PostgreSQL client it already owns.

## Scope

The harness, case types, and runner are the public API — the `dist`/`src` this package ships. The built-in PostgreSQL codec catalogue is not part of that surface: it lives in this package's own `test/` directory (excluded from the published tarball by `files`), where it exercises the same harness an extension author consumes, rather than being general-purpose vocabulary.
