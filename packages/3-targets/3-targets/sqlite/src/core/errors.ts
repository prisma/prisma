/**
 * A `SqliteMigration` operation that needs the materialized control adapter
 * — named by `operation` (e.g. `createTable`, `dropColumn`, `recreateTable`) —
 * was invoked, but the migration was constructed without a `ControlStack`.
 * Concrete authoring usage always goes through the migration CLI entrypoint,
 * which assembles a stack from the loaded `prisma-next.config.ts`; reaching this
 * error means a test fixture or ad-hoc consumer instantiated `SqliteMigration`
 * with the no-arg form (legal for `operations` / `describe` introspection only).
 *
 * The `operation` argument is required so every throw site names the operation
 * that actually failed; a new operation cannot inherit a misattributed message.
 *
 * Distinct from `MIGRATION.UNFILLED_PLACEHOLDER` (placeholder not filled)
 * because the missing input is the stack itself, not the per-operation
 * contract.
 *
 * Lives in `@prisma-next/target-sqlite/errors` rather than the shared
 * framework migration errors module because the failure is target-specific:
 * the contract it talks about (`SqliteMigration`, the SQLite control
 * adapter, the SQLite-target stack) only exists in this package.
