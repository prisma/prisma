/**
 * SQLite's built-in aggregate result matrix, as descriptors.
 *
 * Every row was read off a live SQLite 3.53 (`typeof(<aggregate>(<column>))` over a column of each built-in codec's storage type). SQLite types values, not columns, so what a probe reports is the storage class of the aggregate's result: `sum` over integers stays `integer`, `sum` over reals is `real`, `avg` is `real` for every input, and `min`/`max` return a value of the input's own class.
 *
 * What the database computes and what the application reads are two questions, and the defaults policy answers the second: `count` and `sum` over integers answer as a JS `number` — throwing through the codec's safe-range guard where the value cannot be one — while `countBigInt` and `sumBigInt` answer losslessly. `avg` is already a `real` and so already a `number`, and there is no `avgDecimal`: an exact mean would need a decimal result codec, which SQLite has none of.
 *
 * Two SQLite behaviours shape which pairs get a descriptor at all:
 *
 * - **`sum` of integers does not widen.** An `INTEGER` sum that exceeds a 64-bit integer raises `integer overflow` rather than promoting to a float, so the result is an integer or it is nothing. That raise is the bound `sumBigInt` is offered within — a declared limit of the target, not a gap in it. Neither integer form is `sqlite/integer@1`: a sum of small integers is free to exceed 2^53 while remaining a perfectly good SQLite integer, which `sqlite/bigint@1` carries exactly and `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` refuses rather than rounds.
 * - **`sum` and `avg` coerce rather than refuse.** Over `TEXT` or `BLOB`, SQLite reads a leading number where it can and 0 otherwise, so `sum` over a column of words is `0.0` and over a column of numerals is their total — a result whose very storage class depends on the rows. No descriptor claims those pairs: an aggregate whose result cannot be typed from the schema is one this target declines to offer, and the conformance suite pins the list of pairs left unclaimed for that reason.
 *
 * Result identity is declared; lowering hooks build the expression. A descriptor whose result is an integer wider than a JS number casts the aggregate to text (`castResultToText`) so the value survives the driver's numeric reads and the range error is the codec's own; a lossless variant computes with the SQL aggregate its bare namesake uses, since its name is not the database's. A hook returns an expression and nothing else, so which codec the result carries stays the descriptor's to declare.
