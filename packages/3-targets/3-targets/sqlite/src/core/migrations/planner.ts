 * differ (`buildSqlitePlanDiff`, producing node-typed `SchemaDiffIssue[]`)
 * and delegates to `planIssues` with the registered strategies. Strategies
 * absorb groups of related issues into composite recipes (e.g. recreating a
 * table to apply type/nullability/default/constraint changes at once);
 * anything not absorbed by a strategy flows through `mapNodeIssueToCall` in
 * the issue planner as a one-off call.
 *
 * FK-backing indexes are already merged into the expected table node's
 * `indexes` at derivation (`contractToSchemaIR`'s `convertTable`), so
 * `mapNodeIssueToCall` handles them uniformly alongside user-declared
 * indexes — no separate expansion step in the planner.

   * Three passes, in order:
   * 1. Subtree coalescing — the differ is total (a missing/extra table also
   *    emits an issue for every column/constraint under it); those nested
   *    issues are redundant once the table-level `CreateTable`/`DropTable`
   *    call already accounts for the whole subtree. Runs FIRST, over the
   *    complete diff: a sibling-owned extra table's column issues must
   *    collapse into its one table-level issue before the ownership pass,
   *    because a bare column node carries no table reference — if coalescing
   *    ran after ownership dropped the table-level issue, the orphaned column
   *    issues would survive and the planner would emit drops against a
   *    sibling space's table.
   * 2. Ownership — a live extra is only this plan's to drop when no contract
   *    space owns it. The differ ran against THIS space's contract, so a
   *    table a sibling owns surfaces here as `not-expected`; the planner asks
   *    the ownership oracle (the passive aggregate) whether any space declares
   *    it and, if so, leaves it alone. A table no space owns stays a genuine
   *    extra. Ownership lives in the aggregate; the planner only asks. No
   *    oracle (single-space) keeps every extra.
   * 3. Strict-mode extras gating — `not-expected` (extra table/column/
   *    constraint) issues are dropped entirely outside strict mode, mirroring
   *    the retired coordinate walk's `if (strict) { ...extra_* } }` guards:
   *    an additive-only plan must never even consider dropping an unclaimed
   *    object, not just refuse to emit the drop.

 * The consultation applies ONLY to table-level extras — a live table this
 * space's contract lacks — identified by asking the issue's own node
 * (`nodeKind === table`), never by counting path segments. SQLite is a
 * single-namespace target, so every coordinate is qualified with the shared
 * `UNBOUND_NAMESPACE_ID` sentinel (the same one the aggregate's declared
 * entities carry for this target). `entityKind` is the literal `'table'`:
 * this function only ever asks about a node already confirmed to be
 * `RelationalSchemaNodeKind.table` (checked just above), and that's a
 * diff-tree `nodeKind` spelling (`'sql-table'`) distinct from the storage
 * `entries` vocabulary `elementCoordinates` walks (`'table'`) — the literal
 * is that storage-entries spelling. `declaresEntity` answers over the whole
 * composition (self included), so a positive answer on such a table means
 * another space owns it (a table this space owned would be in its expected
 * tree, never an extra): leave it. A negative answer means no space owns
 * it — a genuine orphan to drop.
 *
 * A DEEPER extra (an extra column/constraint on a table this space DOES own —
 * only the child drifted, so the table is in the expected tree) is this
 * space's own drift and is always kept for dropping; asking the oracle there
 * would wrongly suppress it, because the owned table answers `true`. No oracle
 * ⇒ every extra is kept (single-space plan).
