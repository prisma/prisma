# @prisma/orm-framework

The target-agnostic core of Prisma Next: the contract model, the component/registry system, and the authoring surface that emitted contracts and application code reach at runtime.

Most applications never install this package directly — it arrives as an exact-pinned dependency of a database facade (`@prisma/orm-postgres`, `@prisma/orm-sqlite`, `@prisma/orm-mongo`), which is the package app developers should install. Extension authors and decomposed installs (applications replacing part of the default wiring) depend on it directly.

## Entrypoints

Each subpath namespace consolidates one internal framework module; a bare namespace import (e.g. `@prisma/orm-framework/contract`) aggregates that module's full surface, and deeper paths (e.g. `@prisma/orm-framework/contract/hashing`) select individual modules.

| Namespace | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `/contract` | contract types, validation, hashing, domain resolution |
| `/components` | component descriptors, control stack, registries, codecs |
| `/contract-authoring` | authoring-time contract construction |
| `/psl-parser`, `/psl-printer` | PSL parsing, formatting, printing |
| `/config` | configuration types and validation |
| `/errors` | control, execution, and migration error types |
| `/ids`, `/operations`, `/ts-render`, `/utils` | identifiers, operation model, TypeScript rendering, shared utilities |

## Responsibilities

Everything runtime and authoring code needs independently of a concrete database: contract representation and validation, component wiring, PSL handling, and shared utilities. No database drivers, no build tooling (that is `@prisma/orm-toolchain`).

## Dependencies

Self-contained apart from small third-party runtime libraries (`arktype`, `@standard-schema/spec`, `pathe`, `uniku`). It is the root of the platform-package graph: the family, target, and toolchain packages all depend on it.
