/**
 * What a consumer that mixes import roots actually gets.
 *
 * A published shell bundles a copy of each internal package it carries, so a
 * module reached through `@prisma/orm-*` and the same module reached through
 * its `@internal/*` workspace name are two objects, not one. Nothing about
 * that is visible to a type-checker or a passing unit test: the two copies
 * have identical shapes and identical behaviour, and they differ only where
 * identity is the point — a shared registry, an `instanceof`, a function
 * compared by reference.
 *
 * These tests make the difference observable, so the rule that an in-repo
 * consumer names one root or the other rests on demonstrated behaviour rather
 * than on an argument. `scripts/lint-single-import-root.mjs` enforces the
 * rule; this is the evidence for why it exists.
