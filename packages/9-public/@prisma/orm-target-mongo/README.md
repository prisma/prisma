# @prisma/orm-target-mongo

The concrete MongoDB target of Prisma Next: the target descriptor (migration rendering, codec types, control), the Mongo adapter, and the `mongodb`-based driver.

Applications receive it as an exact-pinned dependency of `@prisma/orm-mongo`; app developers install that facade. Extension authors targeting MongoDB and decomposed installs (for example, replacing the adapter while keeping the target and driver) import this package directly.

## Entrypoints

| Namespace | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `/target` | target descriptor: migration, pack, runtime, control |
| `/adapter` | Mongo adapter: codecs, codec ids, runtime wiring |
| `/driver` | `mongodb`-based driver, plus `/driver/control` |

A bare namespace import (e.g. `@prisma/orm-target-mongo/adapter`) aggregates that layer's full surface; deeper paths select individual modules.

## Responsibilities

Everything MongoDB-target-specific: adapter wiring, codec registration, and the wire connection. Shared Mongo semantics live in `@prisma/orm-family-mongo`.

## Dependencies

`@prisma/orm-framework`, `@prisma/orm-family-mongo`, and `@prisma/orm-toolchain` (exact lockstep pins), `bson`, small third-party runtime libraries, and a `mongodb` peer dependency satisfied by the application or the facade.
