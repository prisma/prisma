   *   but MUST NOT influence eviction behavior and MUST NOT be rethrown.
   * - Dispose of any driver-wide state that depends on this single
   *   connection (e.g. a direct-client driver should close itself, since a
   *   destroyed connection means its one underlying socket is unusable).
   * - Propagate errors raised while tearing down the underlying connection.
   *   The caller has context the driver does not (whether it is already
   *   about to throw a more informative error, whether it is shutting
   *   down, etc.) and is better positioned to decide whether to swallow
