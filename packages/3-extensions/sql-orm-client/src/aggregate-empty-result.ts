 * What an aggregate reads as when there is no row to read at all.
 *
 * SQL answers an empty input set itself — a nullable-declared aggregate
 * collapses to NULL, a non-nullable one to a value SQL still produces, a
 * count's zero cardinality — so this covers only the degenerate case of a
 * result set with no row: an absent aggregate alias, or an include whose
 * envelope never arrived. The answer reads off the operation's declared row:
 * NULL where the row is nullable, else zero decoded through the declared
 * output codec — from canonical decimal text, the JSON form the wide-integer
 * codecs a non-nullable aggregate carries read — so the application sees the
 * same value shape a real row would produce.
