/**
 * TS contract source for the `extension-pgvector` package.
 *
 * Authored against the contract-space package layout convention. The
 * same emit pipeline application authors use is applied here:
 *
 *   `prisma contract emit` → `<package>/src/contract.{json,d.ts}`
 *   `prisma migration plan` → `<package>/migrations/<dirName>/`
 *
 * The descriptor at `src/exports/control.ts` then wires the emitted
 * JSON artefacts via JSON-import declarations.
 *
 * ## IR coverage
 *
 * pgvector ships **no tables** of its own. The single object the
 * extension contributes to the contract IR is the parameterised native
 * type `vector(N)`, registered under `storage.types`. Per-column
 * instances on the user's side carry concrete `typeParams.length`
 * (e.g. `vector(1536)`); the registration here declares the
 * parameterised shape so the verifier sees `vector` as part of
 * pgvector's space contribution and so the pinned `contract.json` on
 * disk is materially distinct from an empty space.
 *
 * Unlike extensions that defer typed objects (composite types /
 * domains / enums) beyond the current IR vocabulary,
 * pgvector's `vector` IS representable in today's IR via
 * {@link StorageTypeInstance}.
 *
 * ## Why TS, not PSL
 *
 * The contract-space package layout convention prefers PSL
 * (`src/contract.prisma`). pgvector is the narrow exception called out
 * in the convention: PSL's `types {}` block instantiates parameterised
 * types at app authoring time (`Vector1536 = pgvector.Vector(1536)`)
 * but has no surface for an extension to register the parameterised
 * BASE type itself (the `storage.types.vector` entry with empty
 * `typeParams` shown below). Until PSL grows that surface, this
 * extension keeps its contract source in TS.
 *
