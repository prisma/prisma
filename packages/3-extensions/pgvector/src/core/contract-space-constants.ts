 * (`../exports/control`) all reference the same values without typos.
 *
 * The space identifier `'pgvector'` is what the framework writes to
 * `migrations/` in the user's repo and what the marker table's
 * `space` column carries for pgvector-owned rows.
 *
 * The `pgvector:*` invariantId namespace is locked here — once
 * published, an invariantId is immutable so downstream consumers can
 * reference it by literal string match.
