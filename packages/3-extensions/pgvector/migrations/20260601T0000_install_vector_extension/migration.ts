/**
 * pgvector baseline migration — install the `vector` Postgres
 * extension and register the invariantId for `vector(N)` columns
 * downstream consumers depend on.
 *
 * The contract IR (see `<package>/src/contract.json`) declares only the
 * parameterised native type `vector(N)` under `storage.types` — pgvector
 * ships no tables of its own. The single op here carries the
 * `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` DDL plus a postcondition that
 * confirms the extension landed; downstream user columns naming
 * `vector(N)` as `nativeType` rely on this op having applied first.
 *
 * The op carries the stable `pgvector:install-vector-v1` invariantId —
 * once published it is immutable.
 *
 * Authoring loop: this file is hand-edited (Path B — see
 * `docs/architecture docs/adrs/ADR 212 - Contract spaces.md`,
 * contract-space package layout section). The CLI's `migration plan`
 * command refuses to scaffold this directory because pgvector's
 * contract has no tables / models for the planner to diff (only a
 * `storage.types` registration, which the planner doesn't translate
 * into a DDL op). The migration directory + Migration subclass + a
 * seed `migration.json` were authored by hand; `node migration.ts`
 * then re-emits `ops.json` + `migration.json` deterministically.
