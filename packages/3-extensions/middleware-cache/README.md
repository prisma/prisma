# @internal/middleware-cache

A family-agnostic, opt-in caching middleware for Prisma Next runtimes.

Built on the `interceptQuery` hook on `RuntimeMiddleware`: on a cache hit, the middleware short-circuits the query and returns the cached rows; the driver is never invoked. On a cache miss, the middleware buffers rows from the driver and commits them to the store on successful completion.

The package depends only on `@internal/framework-components/runtime` — no SQL or Mongo runtime dependency. Cache keys come from `RuntimeMiddlewareContext.contentHash(exec)`, which the family runtime populates, so SQL and Mongo runtimes both work out of the box.

## Responsibilities

- Provide an opt-in caching `RuntimeMiddleware` that short-circuits repeated reads via the `interceptQuery` hook.
- Define the `cacheAnnotation` handle (read-only) that lane terminals (SQL DSL `.annotate(...)`, ORM read terminals) use to attach per-query cache parameters (`ttl`, `skip`, `key`).
- Resolve the cache key per execution: per-query `cacheAnnotation({ key })` override, otherwise `RuntimeMiddlewareContext.contentHash(exec)` from the family runtime.
- Buffer driver rows on a miss and commit to the `CacheStore` only on successful completion (`completed: true && source: 'driver'`).
- Bypass the cache when `RuntimeMiddlewareContext.scope` is `'connection'` or `'transaction'`.
- Ship a default in-memory LRU-with-TTL `CacheStore` and expose the `CacheStore` interface for pluggable backends (Redis, Memcached, etc.).

## Dependencies

- `@internal/framework-components/runtime` — the only production dependency. Provides `RuntimeMiddleware`, `RuntimeMiddlewareContext` (with `contentHash` and `scope`), `defineAnnotation`, `AfterQueryResult`, and query orchestrator integration via `runQueryWithMiddleware`.

The package does **not** depend on `@internal/sql-runtime`, `@internal/mongo-runtime`, or any target adapter. It does not import `node:crypto` — hashing the canonical execution identity is the family runtime's responsibility (via `@internal/utils/hash-identity` in the SQL and Mongo runtimes today).


## Quick start

```typescript
import postgres from '@internal/postgres/runtime';
import {
  cacheAnnotation,
  createCacheMiddleware,
} from '@internal/middleware-cache';
import type { Contract } from './contract.d';
import contractJson from './contract.json' with { type: 'json' };

const db = postgres<Contract>({
  contractJson,
  url: process.env['DATABASE_URL']!,
  middleware: [createCacheMiddleware({ maxEntries: 1000 })],
});

// First call: hits the database, caches the raw rows.
const first = await db.orm.User.first({ id: 1 }, (meta) =>
  meta.annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60_000 })),
);

// Second call with the identical plan: served from cache, driver
// not invoked.
const second = await db.orm.User.first({ id: 1 }, (meta) =>
  meta.annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60_000 })),
);

// Un-annotated queries are never cached — caching is strictly opt-in.
const fresh = await db.orm.User.first({ id: 1 }); // always hits the DB
```

## Opt-in by annotation

The cache middleware acts only on plans that carry a `cacheAnnotation` payload with a `ttl` set:

| Annotation state | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No `cacheAnnotation` on the plan | Pass through; never cached. |
| `cacheAnnotation({ })` (no `ttl`) | Pass through; never cached. |
| `cacheAnnotation({ skip: true })` | Pass through; never cached. |
| `cacheAnnotation({ ttl })` | Cache lookup; commit on miss + success. |
| `cacheAnnotation({ ttl, key })` | As above, but use the supplied key verbatim. |

The annotation is **read-only**: it declares `applicableTo: ['read']`, so the lane gate (TML-2143 M2) rejects passing it to write terminals at both type and runtime levels. "Cache a mutation" is structurally impossible without an `as any` cast bypass at both the type and runtime levels — the cache middleware itself ships without any mutation classifier.

```typescript
// ✓ ORM read terminal accepts the read-only annotation via the meta callback.
await db.orm.User.first({ id }, (meta) => meta.annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60_000 })));

// ✓ Bare-configurator form on `first` — pass `undefined` as the filter to
// attach an annotation without narrowing further. Also valid: chain
// `.where(...)` before `.first(undefined, ...)`.
await db.orm.User.first(undefined, (meta) => meta.annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60_000 })));

// ✗ Type error: write terminal rejects read-only annotation.
await db.orm.User.create(input, (meta) => meta.annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60_000 })));

// ✓ SQL DSL: chainable on select / grouped builders.
const plan = db.sql
  .from(tables.user)
  .select({ id: tables.user.columns.id })
  .annotate(cacheAnnotation({ ttl: 60_000 }))
  .build();
```

## Cache key composition

Two-tier resolution:

1. **Per-query override.** `cacheAnnotation({ key })` — the supplied string is used verbatim. The cache middleware does **not** rehash user-supplied keys; the caller is responsible for keeping the string bounded in size and free of sensitive data they do not want flowing into debug logs, Redis `KEYS` output, persistence dumps, or any user-supplied `CacheStore`. User-supplied keys also bypass the storage-hash discrimination below — if you fix a key, prefix it with something tied to your schema version (e.g. `` `${storageHash}:my-key` ``) to avoid serving stale-schema entries after a migration.
2. **Default.** `RuntimeMiddlewareContext.contentHash(exec)` — the family runtime owns this. The SQL and Mongo runtimes today compose `meta.storageHash + '|' + …` and pipe the result through `hashContent` (SHA-512), producing a bounded, opaque digest of the form `sha512:HEXDIGEST`. The cache middleware uses the returned string directly as the `Map<string, …>` key.

Two consequences worth pinning (both properties of the **default** key path — user-supplied keys above opt out of both):

- **Storage-hash discrimination.** A schema migration changes `meta.storageHash`, which changes `contentHash`, which invalidates cached entries automatically. Stale-schema reads cannot leak across migrations.
- **AST rewrites are part of the key.** Middleware that rewrite the plan via `beforeCompile` (e.g. soft-delete) run **upstream** of the cache. The cache sees the post-lowering plan, so the rewritten SQL is part of the content hash. Adding or removing a `beforeCompile` middleware changes which entries hit.

## `CacheStore` pluggability

The default in-memory store is per-process and **not** coherent across replicas. For shared caching, supply a custom `CacheStore`:

```typescript
import type { CacheStore, CachedEntry } from '@internal/middleware-cache';

const redis: CacheStore = {
  async get(key) {
    const raw = await redisClient.get(key);
    return raw ? (JSON.parse(raw) as CachedEntry) : undefined;
  },
  async set(key, entry, ttlMs) {
    await redisClient.set(key, JSON.stringify(entry), 'PX', ttlMs);
  },
};

const middleware = createCacheMiddleware({ store: redis });
```

The interface is intentionally minimal — `get` returns the entry if present and not expired (implementations gating on TTL should treat expired as absent), `set` writes the entry under the key with the per-call `ttlMs`. Both are async to leave room for I/O-backed stores; the default in-memory store completes synchronously and wraps results in `Promise.resolve` for type conformance.

## Transaction-scope guard

The middleware bypasses the cache entirely when `RuntimeMiddlewareContext.scope` is `'connection'` or `'transaction'`. Only top-level `runtime.query` (`scope === 'runtime'`) consults the store.

This avoids two surprises:

- Inside a transaction, the caller expects read-after-write coherence with their own writes — the cache cannot meaningfully serve those reads without tracking the transaction's pending writes, which is out of scope for this milestone.
- On a checked-out connection (`runtime.connection().query(...)`), the caller has explicitly stepped outside the shared runtime surface and likely does not expect the global cache to inject results.

## TTL and LRU semantics

The default `createInMemoryCacheStore({ maxEntries, clock? })`:

- **TTL.** Each entry is committed with the per-query `ttl` (in milliseconds). The store evaluates expiry against its injected clock (defaults to `Date.now`); reads of expired entries return `undefined` and drop the entry as a side effect.
- **LRU.** Iteration order is the LRU order. Reads and writes both bump recency. When the live count would exceed `maxEntries`, the oldest entry is evicted.
- **Failure handling.** The middleware commits to the store only when `afterQuery` reports `completed: true && source: 'driver'`. Driver errors mid-stream and middleware-served queries never populate the cache.

## Caveats

- **Default store is not coherent across replicas.** Multiple processes / pods do not share state. Use a custom `CacheStore` (Redis, etc.) for cross-process coherence.
- **Concurrent misses both populate the store.** Two concurrent first-time reads of the same key both run the driver and both commit; last writer wins. Single-flight / coalescing semantics are deferred to a follow-up.
- **Reads of stale-on-arrival entries.** With a custom replicated store, a follower may serve a stale entry for a brief window after the writer commits. Use the storage-hash discrimination plus a sensible TTL.
- **No invalidation beyond TTL.** Entries are not invalidated by writes; tag-based or event-based invalidation is out of scope for this milestone. If a write invalidates a cached read, choose a TTL short enough to bound the staleness window, or pass `cacheAnnotation({ skip: true })` on the read that needs to be authoritative.
