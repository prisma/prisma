# Prisma Framework 


This repository is used as a central point to collect information and issues around the **Prisma Framework** (formerly called [Prisma 2](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-zq1s745db8i5/)) while it's in Preview. It also contains the [documentation](./docs) and the [code of the Prisma Framework CLI](./cli).

ðŸ’¡ The Prisma Framework is currently in Preview! [Limitations](./docs/limitations.md) include missing features and limited performance issues. You can track the progress of the Prisma Framework on [**`isprisma2ready.com`**](https://www.isprisma2ready.com).

To get started, you can explore a number of ready-to-run [examples](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2) or follow the holistic [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md). The example projects include use cases such as building GraphQL, REST or gRPC APIs (with Node.js or TypeScript) using the Prisma Framework.

## What is the Prisma Framework?

The Prisma Framework (formerly called [Prisma 2](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-zq1s745db8i5/)) is a database framework that consists of these tools:

- [**Photon**](https://photonjs.prisma.io/): Type-safe and auto-generated database client ("ORM replacement")
- [**Lift**](https://lift.prisma.io/): Declarative data modeling and migrations
- [**Studio**](https://github.com/prisma/studio): Admin UI to support various database workflows

While each tool can be used standalone (in both [_greenfield_ and _brownfield_ projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development))), they integrate nicely through common components like the [**Prisma schema**](./docs/prisma-schema-file.md) or the [Prisma Framework CLI](./docs/prisma2-cli.md).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with [Photon](https://github.com/prisma/photonjs) and/or [Lift](https://github.com/prisma/lift) is by using the `init` command of the `prisma2` CLI via [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx):

```
npx prisma2 init hello-prisma
```

Alternatively, you can install the `prisma2` CLI globally and run the `init` command then:

```
npm install -g prisma2
prisma2 init hello-prisma
```

The interactive prompt will ask you to provide database credentials for your database. If you don't have a database yet, select **SQLite** and let the CLI set up a database file for you.
