# Prisma 2

This repository is used as a central point to collect information and issues around [Prisma 2](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-zq1s745db8i5/) while it's in Preview. It also contains the [documentation](./docs) and the [code of the Prisma 2 CLI](./cli).

ðŸ’¡ Prisma 2 is currently in Preview! [Limitations](./docs/limitations.md) include missing features, limited performance and stability issues. You can track the progress of Prisma 2 on [**`isprisma2ready.com`**](https://www.isprisma2ready.com).

## What is Prisma?

Prisma is an application data framework consisting of these tools:

- [**Photon**](https://photonjs.prisma.io/): Type-safe and auto-generated database client ("ORM replacement")
- [**Lift**](https://lift.prisma.io/): Declarative data modeling and migrations
- [**Studio**](https://github.com/prisma/studio): Admin UI to support various database workflows

While each tool can be used standalone (in both [_greenfield_ and _brownfield_ projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development))), they integrate nicely through common components like the [**Prisma schema**](./docs/prisma-schema-file.md) or the [Prisma 2 CLI](./docs/prisma2-cli.md).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with [Photon](https://github.com/prisma/photonjs) and/or [Lift](https://github.com/prisma/lift) is by installing the Prisma 2 CLI and running the interactive `init` command:

```
npm install -g prisma2
prisma2 init hello-prisma
```

The interactive prompt will ask you to provide database credentials for your database. If you don't have a database yet, select **SQLite** and let the CLI set up a database file for you.

Learn more about the `prisma2 init` flow [here](./docs/getting-started.md) or get started with a holistic [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md).
