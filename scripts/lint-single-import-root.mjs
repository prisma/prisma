/**
 * Every consumer package names one import root, never both.
 *
 * A published shell (`@prisma/orm-*`) bundles a copy of each internal package
 * it carries, so a module reached through a shell and the same module reached
 * through its `@internal/*` workspace name are two objects. A package that
 * names both roots therefore runs two copies of everything they share: two
 * registries, two sets of classes, two of every value compared by reference.
 * See `packages/9-public/@prisma/orm-framework/test/module-identity.test.ts`
 * for the demonstration.
 *
 * The failure is silent. Both copies type-check, both behave identically in
 * isolation, and the divergence shows up only as an `instanceof` that stops
 * holding or a lookup that stops finding — which is why this is a lint and
 * not something left to review.
 *
 * Scope is the consumer trees: `examples/`, `apps/` and `test/`. Packages
 * under `packages/` are the substrate the shells are built from and name
 * workspace packages by construction; the shells' own tests legitimately name
 * both, and are excluded with them.
 *
 * Exits 1 listing every mixed package; exits 0 otherwise.
