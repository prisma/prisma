# Non-ported — relation-mode-gh-m-to-n (SQL m:n)

Source: `packages/client/tests/functional/relationMode-in-separate-gh-action/tests_m-to-n.ts`
(prisma/prisma@a6d0155, `manyToManySQLExplicit` branch). The `relationMode=foreignKeys`
matrix cells (both `isSchemaUsingMap=false` and `=true`) are ported under
`test/ports/prisma/functional/relation-mode-gh-m-to-n/` (`create.test.ts`, `update.test.ts`,
`delete.test.ts`). The `relationMode=prisma` matrix entries below are non-ported: prisma-next
has no client-side `relationMode=prisma` referential-action emulation — it relies on real DB
foreign keys — so the emulated no-real-FK-check behaviour these tests exercise cannot be
expressed. One line per source test (each runs across all matrix actions).
