# `react-prisma`

This package allows using the Prisma Client in a React Server Component.
It is a thin wrapper arround `@prisma/client`.

**This is highly experimental. Don't use this in any real application**

We just publish this early for demonstration purposes.

# This is unstable

We don't guarantee that this works. Any moment the underlying `react` api can change and break this package.

# Known limitations

Right now this package does not support:

- query chaining, like:

```ts
prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: 42 } }).posts()
```

- mutations, only `findMany`, `findFirst`, `findOne`, `findUnique` operations are allowed.
