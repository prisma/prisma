      You are trying to load env variables which are already present in your project root .env

            You can fix this by removing the .env file from "/client/src/__tests__/integration/happy/blog-dot-env-both-conflict/prisma/.env" and move its contents to your .env file at the root "/client/src/__tests__/integration/happy/blog-dot-env-both-conflict/.env"
