exports[`should throw error 1`] = `

      You are trying to load env variables which are already present in your project root .env
      	Root: /tmp/dir/.env
      	Prisma: ./prisma/.env
      	Env Conflicts:
      		SHOULD_THROW

      You can fix this by removing the .env file from "./prisma/.env" and move its contents to your .env file at the root "/tmp/dir/.env"
