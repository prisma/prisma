# Prisma Next — Feature-Support Matrix (Prisma 8 RC1)

This is the Prisma Next feature-support matrix feeding PR #986 (the Prisma 8 RC1 release). Each row is one feature; the three data columns state **whether that feature is available in Prisma Next** for **Postgres**, **SQLite**, and **MongoDB** — not whether Prisma 7 had it. The matrix lists *all* features Prisma Next exposes (mined from `prisma-8-api.md`), plus every notable Prisma 7 feature Prisma Next lacks, so that absences are named rather than silently missing. The **Prisma Next evidence** column points only to Prisma Next (TypeScript) test suites; Rust/engine tests and Prisma 7 tests are never cited here. When a cell is `🟡` the evidence is intentionally empty — that emptiness is what makes it untested rather than proven.

The matrix is split by category across the [`scorecard/`](scorecard/) directory — this page is the index. Each category file is self-contained (it repeats the legend below) and holds that category's table(s) verbatim. Follow the links in the [Categories](#categories) section to reach a specific category.

Legend:

- `✅` **Works** — proven by a Prisma Next **integration** test (one that executes the feature against a database — Postgres via PGlite, SQLite via its real driver, or MongoDB via mongodb-memory-server — and asserts the observable runtime result). Unit-tier tests (SQL/AST/plan/type/snapshot assertions, or any test that never hits a database) do not qualify. Per-database rigor applies: a Postgres integration test cannot justify a SQLite or MongoDB `✅`, and vice versa.
- `🟡` **Untested** — reachable through the Prisma Next public surface, but no proving Prisma Next integration test exists yet (evidence left blank). This includes features whose only backing is a unit-tier test.
- `🧪` **Experimental** — shipped in Prisma Next but outside the stability promise (polymorphism / multi-table inheritance).
- `❌` **Not in 8.0** — deliberately absent from Prisma Next.
- `—` **n/a** — feature does not apply to that database.

Each row names exactly one capability. Where an operator/command/stage set was previously bundled, it has been split so every distinct feature carries its own per-database verdict and its own evidence.

The Migrations file gathers all twelve `Migrations — *` sub-topics (workflow; columns & types; IDs, PKs & autoincrement; foreign keys; indexes & unique; enums; defaults; native types; extensions; views; existing-data safety; schema filters) as sub-headings within a single file.

Verdicts are computed per feature row across the three DB columns; the tallies below count individual non-`—` cells.

Across 593 atomic feature rows (one capability each), spanning 1,779 per-database cells (593 rows × 3 databases): `✅` 416, `🟡` 488, `🧪` 12, `❌` 244 (and 619 `—` n/a cells).

Per-database tallies:

| Database | ✅ | 🟡 | 🧪 | ❌ | — |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Postgres | 222 | 136 | 4 | 111 | 120 |
| SQLite | 85 | 235 | 4 | 98 | 171 |
| MongoDB | 109 | 117 | 4 | 35 | 328 |
